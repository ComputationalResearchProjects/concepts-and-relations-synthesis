With O

the O

Therefore, O

Altogether, O

the O

Thus, O
we O

Moreover, O
the O

Hence, O

we O

However, O
as O

it O

In O

as O
expected O
(H2_2), O

Although O
we O
did O
not O

when O
we O
assumed O

when O
we O
allowed O
the O

to O
vary O

we O
found O
that O

even O
though O
the O

is O
small O
(at O

it O
increases O
the O

by O
approximately O
3 O

Meanwhile, O
dissimilar O
comments O
without O
any O

may O
cause O
negative O

(see O

and O
strengthen O

Therefore, O

However, O

According O
to O
the O
results, O
H1 B-NU

are O
supported O
because O
there O
is O
a O
positive O

effect O

a O

and O
significant O

However, O
extroversion O
has O
no O
significant O
influence O
on O

rejecting O
H3_ B-NU
The O

suggest O
that O
the O

positively O
influence O
attitude O

but O
that O
they O
have O
no O

Thus, O
H4a B-NU

supported O
but O
H4b B-NU
is O
not O

Positive O
effects O
of O
perceived O
enjoyment O
on O

were O
proposed, O
but O
only O
the O
positive O

while O

Related O

the O
relationship O
between O

(H6a) O

the O
findings O
show O
a O

So O
the O

the O

on O
the O

The O
positive O

supported O
our O
assertion O
that O
the O

of O

is O
mediated O
by O

and O

sequentially O
(H3)_ O
We O
illustrated O
that O
the O
effect O
of O
self-schema O
on O
self-discrepancy O
is O
an O
underlying O
mechanism O
that O
could O
explain O
the O

satisfaction, O
which O
would O
establish O
the O
second O
main O
theoretical O
contribution O
of O
this O

in O

to O
the O
existing O

Hence, O
Hla B-NU
and O
H3a B-NU
are O
supported O
at O
p O

whereas O
H2a B-NU

marginally O
supported O
because O
ACC(WTU) O

ACC(WT) O

at O
p O
< O

By O
comparing O
the O
results O
of O
the O
two O
groups O
related O
to O
H3a, O
we O
conclude O
that O
after O
introducing O
topic-based O
features, O
the O
effect O
of O
user-based O
features O
is O
weakened O
in O
terms O
of O
accuracy O

Thus, O
H2b B-NU

partly O
supported, O
whereas O
Hlb B-NU

are O
supported O
at O
p<0_001_ O
Although O

This O
could O
be O
regarded O
a O
piece O
of O
evidence O
that O

are O
sometimes O
unreliable O
because O

may O

Hlc B-NU

Besides, O
the O
reason O
why O
HIc B-NU

H3c B-NU
are O
supported O
in O
another O
direction O
is O
that O
the O
unbalanced O

that O

(H, O

Second, O
the O

of O

for O

on O

is O
positive O

(H3 O

Finally, O
the O

the O

an O

for O
the O

As O

the O

that O

Thus, O
