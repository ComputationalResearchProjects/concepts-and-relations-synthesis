Given O
the O
above-mentioned O
findings, O
we O
have O
formulated O
the O
hypotheses O
concerning O
the O
relationship O
between O

eWOM O
as O
follows: O
H1: B-NE
There O
is O
a O
negative O

between O

and O
eWOM O
volume O

H2: B-PO
There O
is O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction O
and O
eWOM O
valence O

This O
is O
why O
we O
formulate O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H1’: B-PO
Gender O
moderates O
the O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction O
and O
eWOM O
volume O

This O
led O
us O
to O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H2’: B-PO
Intensity O
of O
Facebook O
usage O
moderates O
the O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction O
and O
eWOM O
volume O

Based O
on O
the O
previous O
results O
in O
literature, O
our O
hypotheses O
regarding O
the O
relationships O
between O
commitment O
and O
eWOM O
are O
expressed O
as O
follows: O
H3: B-PO
There O
is O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O
affective O
commitment O
and O
eWOM O
volume O

H4: B-PO
There O
is O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O

commitment O
and O
eWOM O
valence O

H5: B-PO
There O
is O
no O
relationship O
between O

eWOM O
volume O

H6: B-PO
There O
is O
no O
relationship O
between O

commitment O
and O
eWOM O

Thus, O
our O
two O
first O
hypotheses O
are O
as O
follows: O
Hypothesis B-PO
1: I-PO
The O
retweet O
network O
will O
show O
the O
homophilic O
behavior O
of O
the O
users O

Hypothesis B-PO
2: I-PO
The O
retweet O
overlaps O
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
measure O
for O
political O
distances O
between O
parties O

Thus, O
we O
predict: O
Hypothesis B-PO
1: I-PO
Immersion O
into O
a O
political O
narrative O
will O
lead O
to O
higher O
levels O
of O
perceived O
personal O
relevance O

Thus, O
we O
predict:McLaughlin O
and O
Velez O
27 O
Hypothesis B-PO
4: I-PO
Political O
messages O
delivered O

will O
lead O
to O
greater O
levels O
of O
political O
immersion O
than O
messages O
delivered O
through O

We O
therefore O
predict: O
Hypothesis B-PO
5: I-PO
Political O
messages O
delivered O
through O
Twitter O
will O
lead O
to O
lower O
levels O
of O
political O
immersion O
than O
messages O
delivered O
through O
television O
or O

Thus, O
we O
formulated O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H3: B-PO
Internet O
use O
for O
news O
reading O
yields O
a O
stronger O
relationship O
between O
Internet O
use O
and O
political O
participation O
than O
does O
Internet O
use O
excluding O
news O
reading O

Hence, O
we O
divided O
the O
years O
of O
the O
surveys O
into O
three O
periods: O
1997-2002, O
2003-2008, O
and O
2009-2014, O
and O
we O
formulated O
the O
followed O
hypothesis: O
H6: B-PO
Surveys O
conducted O
from O
2009 O
to O
2014 O
will O
yield O
the O
strongest O
relationship O
between O
Internet O
use O
and O
political O
participation, O
followed O
by O
surveys O
from O
2003 O

and O
those O
from O
1997 O
to O
2002 O
in O
decreasing O
order O
of O
strength O
of O
relationship O

Therefore, O
we O
can O
make O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O

Hypothesis B-NU

The O
words O
that O

express O
a O
Twitter O

We O
can O
even O
make O
another O
hypothesis O
as O
follows: O

Hypothesis B-PO
2: I-PO
The O
higher O
the O
frequency O
an O

a O

user, O
the O
more O

it O

H4: B-PO
Overall, O
individuals O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
comment O

In O

we O

Thus, O
we O

Our O

Given O
these O

Thus, O
the O

Finally, O

Therefore, O

Consequently, O
the O

H1 B-PO
Access O

In O
line O
with O
the O
above O
discussion, O
we O
formulate O
the O
following O
research O
hypothesis: O
H1_ B-PO
Consumer O
eWOM O
engagement O
on O
SNS O
is O
a O
bi-dimensional O
construct O
comprised O
of O
consumer O
intentions O
to O
send O
and O
receive O
brand-related O
information O

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H2_ B-PO
Consumer O
attitude O
toward O
SNS O
eWOM O
messages O
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumer O
eWOM O
engagement O

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H3_ B-PO
The O
perceived O
credibility O
of O
an O
eWOM O
message O
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumer O
attitude O
toward O

Hence, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H4_ B-PO
SC-bridging O
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumers’ O
attitude O
toward O

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H5_ B-PO
SC-bridging O
will O
be O

proposed: O
H6_ B-PO
SC-bonding O
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumers’ O
attitude O

Hence, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H7_ B-PO
SC-bonding O
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
perceived O

Hence, O
we O
propose O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H8_ B-PO
SNS O
type O
will O
moderate O
the O
relationship O
between O
SC-bridging O
and O
attitude, O
such O
that O
the O
relationship O
between O
SC-bridging O
and O
attitude O
will O
be O
stronger O
for O
Facebook O
than O
WhatsApp O

Therefore, O
the O
first O
two O
hypotheses O
test O
the O
relationship O
between O
employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
and O
employee O
perception O
of O
privacy O
violation, O
which O
is O
moderated O
by O
employees’ O
ability O
to O
control O
their O
SNS O
information: O
H1_ B-PO
Employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
employee O
perception O
of O

H2_ B-PO
Employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
will O
be O
more O
positively O
related O
to O
employee O
perception O
of O
privacy O
violations O
when O
employees O
have O
less O
ability O
to O
control O
their O
information O
on O
SNSs O

The O
third O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed O
as O
follows: O
H3_ B-NE
Employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
will O
be O
negatively O
related O
to O
employee O
perceived O
procedural O

In O
line O
with O
the O
third O
hypothesis, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
address O
the O
relationship O
between O
employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring, O
employee O
perceived O
privacy O

H4a_ B-NE
Employee O
perception O

will O
be O

H4b_ B-PO
Perceived O
privacy O

will O
partially O
mediate O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
and O
employees’ O
perception O
of O
procedural O
justice O

Consequently, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
suggested: O
H5_ B-NE
Employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
will O
be O
more O
negatively O

justice O
when O
there O
is O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
transparency O
in O

Accordingly, O
we O
propose O
the O
last O
hypothesis O
as O
follows: O
H6_ B-PO
Employees O
who O
perceive O

will O
have O
a O
lower O

In O
this O

our O

to O

if O
using O
a O

(i_e_, O

that O

We O
expect O
that O

stronger O
attitudes O

be O
associated O
with O

Another O
primary O
tenet O

that O

whether O

Thus, O
we O

that O
those O
who O

congruent O
with O
the O

of O

One O
can O
speculate O
that O
SNS O

may O
negatively O
impair O
the O

performance O
in O
the O

leading O
to O
the O
hypothesis O

This O
constant O
thinking O
about O

that O
they O
want O
to O
do O
on O

makes O
it O
hard O
for O
them O
to O

tasks, O
leading O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
H2_ B-PO
Greater O

Accordingly, O
in O
this O
paper, O
it O
is O
posited O
that O
the O
divided O
attention O
resulting O
from O
SNS O

can O
prevent O

from O

thus O
leading O
to O
the O
hypothesis O

Therefore, O
it O
is O

that O

Replicating O

participants O

those O

Hypothesis B-PO

Participants O
who O
are O
not O

(whether O
they O
are O
permitted O

will O
become O
more O

those O
students O
who O
are O

will O
moderate O
the O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
advanced: O
H1_ B-PO
Individuals O

prefer O
Instagram O

while O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
advanced: O
H2a_ B-PO
After O
being O
primed O
by O

users O
will O
exhibit O
higher O

H2b_ B-PO
After O

H3a_ B-PO
Individuals O

Therefore, O
our O
first O
hypothesis O

as O
follows: O

Differences O

between O
men O

women O
regarding O
the O

Therefore, O
we O
predict O
the O
following O
more O

hypothesis: O
H2: B-PO
Gratifications O
that O
are O
connected O
with O
a O
comparison O
of O

are O
more O

Based O
on O
the O
gender O
differences O
in O

in O

we O
also O
assume O
that O
the O

of O

applications O
(e_g_, O

are O

we O

the O
final O
hypothesis: O
H3: B-PO
Differences O
exist O
between O
men O

the O

We O
thus O
hypothesised O
that: O
H1_ B-PO
Online O

be O
more O

On O
the O

we O
predicted O

We O
therefore, O
hypothesis O
that: O

be O
attributed O

As O
a O

of O
the O
above, O
we O
suggest O
the O
following O
hypotheses: O
H1: B-PO
Social O

Since O
social O

gaming O
is O
also O
a O
kind O
of O
hedonic O
systems, O
we O
made O
the O
following O
hypotheses: O
(H6) O
Perceived O

(H7) O

(H8) O
Perceived O

(PE) O
positively O
perceived O

Hence, O
two O

are O
posited O
as O
follows: O
(H9) O
Use O

Consequently, O
we O
have O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
(H11) O
Flow O

positively O

(BI) O
to O

Those O

and O
therefore O
we O

the O

hypotheses: O
(H12) O

(H13) O

Hence, O
our O

The O

(H|h)1a: O

Second, O
we O
test O
the O
two O

Strategic O

(Fridkin O

H2a: B-PO
Male O
gubernatorial O

presumably O
because O

Thus O
we O

We O
therefore O
propose O
H2a_ B-NU
Females O

Thus, O
we O

H2b_ B-NU
Females O

Thus, O
we O

Thus, O
we O

H3b_ B-NU
Females O

Thus, O
we O

we O

the O

Therefore, O
we O
expect O
that: O
H5a: B-NE
The O
longer O
adolescents O
have O
been O
active O
on O
SNSs, O
the O
less O
they O
will O
protect O

Hence, O
we O
expect O
that: O
H5b: B-PO
The O
longer O

have O
been O
active O
on O

the O
more O

be O

As O
a O
final O
result, O
our O

reveals O
a O
negative O

and O
the O
extent O
to O
which O

protect O

by O

(H5a)_ O
The O

as O

users, O
the O
less O

they O
are O
to O
protect O
their O

Moreover, O
a O
positive O
association O
was O
observed O
between O
profile O
page O

and O
the O
number O
of O
friends O
that O
adolescents O
have O
on O

(H5b): O
the O
longer O
they O
have O
been O
active O
on O

the O
more O
likely O
they O
have O
a O
large O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
regarding O
how O
information O
risk O
will O
affect O
personal O
information O
privacy O
concerns O
are O
offered: O
(H|h)1a: O
Perceived O
SNS O
information O

increases O
users’ O
perceived O
information O

concerns O

HI1b: B-PO
Perceived O
SNS O
information O
risk O
increases O
users’ O
perceived O
information O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
posited O
about O
the O
effect O
of O
social O
risk O
on O
personal O
information O
concerns: O
H2a: B-PO
Perceived O
SNS O

H2b: B-PO
Perceived O

Given O
this O
fact O
and O
that O
its O
impact O
on O
information O

can O
decline O
over O
time, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
suggested: O
H3a: B-PO
An O
increase O
in O
the O

of O

period O
weakens O
the O

and O
information O

concerns O

H3b: B-PO
An O
increase O
in O
the O
length O
of O
users’ O
usage O
period O
weakens O
the O
relationship O
between O
perceived O

information O

and O
information O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
posited: O
H4a: B-PO
A O
higher O
proportion O
of O
offline O
relationships O
among O
SNS O
friends O
strengthens O
the O
relationship O
between O
perceived O
SNS O
social O
risk O
and O
perceived O
information O

concerns O

Thus O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
proposed: O
H5a: B-PO
Perceived O
information O
misuse O
concerns O
lessen O

intention O
to O

information O

H5b: B-PO
Perceived O
information O
misuse O
concerns O
lessen O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
posited: O
H6a: B-PO
Perceived O
information O

lessen O
users’ O
intention O
to O
give O

information O

H6b: B-PO
Perceived O
information O
misunderstanding O
concerns O
lessen O
users’ O
intention O
to O
give O

information O

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
proposed: O
H7a: B-PO
Intention O
to O
give O

information O
increases O
users’ O
continued O

H7b: B-PO
Intention O
to O
give O
self-presentational O
information O
increases O

Hence: O
Hypothesis B-NE

the O

Cognitive-emotional O

Hence: O
Hypothesis B-PO

the O

Hypothesis B-PO

self-efficacy O

Therefore, O
we O

Agreeableness O
is O

As O

we O

the O

Introversion O
is O
negatively O

Hypothesis B-NE
13: I-NE
Introversion O
is O
