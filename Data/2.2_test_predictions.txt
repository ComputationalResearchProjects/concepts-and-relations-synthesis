Because O

Therefore, O

which O

Given O

I O
hypothesize O
the O

Given O
the O
above-mentioned O
findings, O
we O
have O
formulated O
the O
hypotheses O
concerning O
the O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction O
and O
eWOM O
as O
follows: O
H1: O
There O
is O
a O
negative O
relationship O
between O

volume I-DV

H2: O
There O
is O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction B-IV
and O
eWOM B-DV
valence I-DV

This O
is O
why O
we O
formulate O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H1’: O
Gender B-MO
moderates O
the O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction B-IV
and O
eWOM B-DV
volume I-DV

This O
led O
us O
to O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H2’: O
Intensity B-IV
of I-IV
Facebook I-IV
usage I-IV
moderates O
the O
relationship O
between O
satisfaction B-IV
and O
eWOM B-DV
volume I-DV

Based O
on O
the O
previous O
results O
in O
literature, O
our O
hypotheses O
regarding O
the O
relationships O
between O
commitment O
and O
eWOM O
are O
expressed O
as O
follows: O
H3: O
There O
is O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O
affective B-IV
commitment I-IV
and O
eWOM B-DV
volume I-DV

H4: O
There O
is O
a O
positive O
relationship O
between O
affective B-IV
commitment I-IV
and O
eWOM B-DV
valence I-DV

H5: O
There O
is O
no O
relationship O
between O

eWOM B-DV
volume I-DV

H6: O
There O
is O
no O
relationship O
between O
high B-IV
sacrifice I-IV
commitment I-IV
and O
eWOM B-DV
valence I-DV

Thus, O
our O
two O
first O
hypotheses O
are O
as O
follows: O
Hypothesis O
1: O
The B-IV
retweet I-IV
network I-IV
will O
show O
the B-DV
homophilic I-DV
behavior I-DV
of I-DV
the I-DV
users I-DV

Hypothesis O
2: O
The B-IV
retweet I-IV
overlaps I-IV
can O
be O
used O
as O
a O
measure O
for O
political B-DV
distances I-DV
between I-DV
parties I-DV

Thus, O
we O
predict: O
Hypothesis O
1: O
Immersion B-IV
into I-IV
a I-IV
political I-IV
narrative I-IV
will O
lead O
to O
higher O
levels O
of O
perceived B-DV
personal I-DV
relevance I-DV

Thus, O
we O
predict:McLaughlin O
and O
Velez O
27 O
Hypothesis O
4: O
Political B-IV
messages I-IV
delivered I-IV
through I-IV
television I-IV
will O
lead O
to O
greater B-DV
levels I-DV
of I-DV
political I-DV
immersion I-DV
than O
messages O
delivered O
through O
e-mail O
or O
Twitter O

We O
therefore O
predict: O
Hypothesis O
5: O
Political B-IV
messages I-IV
delivered I-IV
through I-IV
Twitter I-IV
will O
lead O
to O
lower B-DV
levels I-DV
of I-DV
political I-DV
immersion I-DV
than O
messages O
delivered O
through O
television O
or O
e-mail O

Thus, O
we O
formulated O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H3: O
Internet B-IV
use I-IV
for I-IV
news I-IV
reading I-IV
yields O
a O
stronger O
relationship O
between O
Internet B-IV
use I-IV
and O
political B-DV
participation I-DV
than O
does O

use O
excluding O

reading O

Hence, O
we O
divided O
the O
years O
of O
the O
surveys O
into O
three O
periods: O
1997-2002, O
2003-2008, O
and O
2009-2014, O
and O
we O
formulated O
the O
followed O
hypothesis: O
H6: O
Surveys B-IV
conducted I-IV
from I-IV
2009 I-IV
to I-IV
2014 I-IV
will O
yield O
the O
strongest O
relationship O
between O

use I-IV
and O
political B-DV
participation, I-DV
followed O
by O
surveys O
from O
2003 O

2008 O
and O
those O
from O
1997 O
to O
2002 O
in O
decreasing O
order O

Therefore, O
we O
can O

the O

are O
more O
likely O
to O
comment B-DV

Thus, O
we O

” O
Based O
on O
the O
extant O
literature, O
several O
initial O
hypotheses O
can O

be O
proposed: O
H1: O

In O
line O
with O
the O
above O
discussion, O
we O
formulate O
the O
following O
research O
hypothesis: O
H1_ O
Consumer B-IV
eWOM I-IV
engagement I-IV
on I-IV
SNS I-DV
is O
a O
bi-dimensional O
construct O
comprised O
of O
consumer B-DV
intentions I-DV
to I-DV
send I-DV
and I-DV
receive I-DV
brand-related I-DV
information I-DV

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H2_ O
Consumer B-IV
attitude I-IV
toward I-IV
SNS I-IV
eWOM I-IV
messages I-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumer B-DV
eWOM I-DV
engagement I-DV

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H3_ O
The B-IV
perceived I-IV
credibility I-IV
of I-IV
an I-IV
eWOM I-IV
message I-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumer B-DV
attitude I-DV
toward I-DV
SNS I-DV

Hence, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H4_ O
SC-bridging B-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumers’ B-DV
attitude I-DV
toward I-DV
SNS I-DV
eWOM I-DV
messages I-DV

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H5_ O
SC-bridging B-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O

Hence, O
the O

hypothesis O
is O
proposed: O
H6_ O
SC-bonding B-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
consumers’ B-DV
attitude I-DV
toward I-DV

Hence, O
the O

hypothesis O

proposed: O
H7_ O
SC-bonding B-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
perceived B-DV

credibility I-DV

Hence, O
we O
propose O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H8_ O
SNS B-MO
type I-MO
will O
moderate O
the O
relationship O
between O
SC-bridging B-IV
and O
attitude, B-DV
such O
that O
the O
relationship O
between O
SC-bridging O
and O
attitude O
will O
be O
stronger O
for O
Facebook B-MO
than I-MO
WhatsApp I-MO

Therefore, O
the O
first O
two O
hypotheses O
test O
the O
relationship O
between O
employer O
use O
of O
SNS O
monitoring O
and O
employee O
perception O
of O
privacy O
violation, O
which O
is O
moderated O
by O
employees’ O
ability O
to O
control O
their O
SNS O
information: O
H1_ O
Employer B-IV
use I-IV
of I-IV
SNS I-IV
monitoring I-IV
will O
be O
positively O
related O
to O
employee B-DV
perception I-DV
of I-DV
privacy I-DV
violations I-DV

H2_ O
Employer B-IV
use I-IV

monitoring I-IV
will O
be O
more O
positively O
related O
to O
employee B-DV
perception I-DV
of I-DV
privacy I-DV
violations I-DV
when O
employees O
have O
less O
ability O
to O
control O
their O
information O
on O
SNSs O

The O
third O
hypothesis O
is O
proposed O
as O
follows: O
H3_ O
Employer B-IV
use I-IV
of I-IV
SNS I-IV
monitoring I-IV
will O
be O
negatively O
related O
to O
employee B-DV
perceived I-DV
procedural I-DV
justice I-DV

In O
line O
with O
the O
third O
hypothesis, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
address O
the O
relationship O
between O

and O
procedural O
justice: O

Employee B-IV

will O
be O
negatively O
related O
to O
employee B-DV
perceived I-DV
procedural I-DV

H4b_ O
Perceived B-ME
privacy I-ME

will O
partially O
mediate O
the O
relationship O
between O
the B-IV
employer I-IV
use I-IV
of I-IV
SNS I-IV
monitoring I-IV
and O
employees’ B-DV
perception I-DV
of I-DV

Consequently, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
suggested: O
H5_ O
Employer B-IV
use I-IV

will O
be O
more O

procedural I-DV
justice I-DV
when O
there O
is O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
transparency O

Accordingly, O
we O
propose O
the O
last O
hypothesis O
as O
follows: O
H6_ O
Employees B-IV
who I-IV
perceive I-IV
procedural I-IV

will O
have O
a B-DV
lower I-DV

In O
this O

our O
purpose O

to O
understand O
if O
using O
a O
supplementary O
social O

application O
(i_e_, O

when O

Thus, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O

The O

theory O
noted, O
however, O
that O
some O

will O
always O
be O
willing B-DV

We O
expect O
that O
having B-IV

be O
associated O
with O

willingness B-DV

(H2)_ O
Another O
primary O
tenet O
of O
SoS O
is O
that O
individuals O
speak O
out I-DV

on O
their O
assessment I-IV
of I-IV
the I-IV
opinion I-IV

and O
whether O
their O
opinion O
aligns O
with O
the O
majority O
(Noelle-Neumann, O
1974, O
1993) O

Thus, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O
those B-IV
who I-IV

opinion I-IV
is I-IV
congruent I-IV
with I-IV

accounts O
for O
perceptions B-DV

Thus, O
we O
expect O
that O
perceptions B-IV

be O
associated O
with O
opinion B-DV

important O
to O

we O

H1: O

As O

we O

Given O

the O

hypotheses O
were O
developed: O
Hypothesis O
1: O
Replicating O
previous O
research, O
participants B-IV
who I-IV
are I-IV
allowed I-IV
to I-IV
have I-IV
their I-IV
cell I-IV
phones I-IV
(regardless I-IV
of I-IV
the I-IV
cell I-IV

policy) I-IV
will O
become B-DV
more I-DV
distracted I-DV

thus I-DV
perform I-DV
worse I-DV
on I-DV
the I-DV
multiple-choice I-DV
test I-DV
than O
those O
students O
who O
do O
not O
have O

Hypothesis O
2: O
Participants B-IV
who I-IV
are I-IV
not I-IV
permitted I-IV
to I-IV
use I-IV
their I-IV
phone I-IV
(whether I-IV
they I-IV
are I-IV
permitted I-IV
to I-IV
keep I-IV
it I-IV
or I-IV
have I-IV
it I-IV
removed) I-IV
will O
become B-DV
more I-DV
distracted I-DV
and I-DV
thus I-DV
will I-DV
perform I-DV
worse I-DV
on I-DV
the I-DV
multiple-choice I-DV
test I-DV
than O
those O
students O
who O
are O
permitted O
to O
use O
their O
cell O
phone O
without O
any O
restrictions O

Hypothesis O

Individual B-MO
differences I-MO
in I-MO

will O
moderate O
the O
impact O
of O
cell B-IV

condition I-IV
on O

test I-DV
performance I-DV

Specifically, O
the O
size I-DV
of I-DV
the I-DV
individual I-DV
differences I-DV

hypothesized O
earlier O
(Hypothesis O

will O
be O

the O
conditions O
when O

are O
allowed O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O
is O
advanced: O
H1_ O
Individuals B-IV
with I-IV
higher I-IV
self-monitoring I-IV
will O
prefer B-DV
Instagram B-IV
to I-IV
Pinterest, I-DV
while O
low O
self-monitors O
will O
prefer O
Pinterest O
to O
Instagram O

Thus, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
advanced: O
H2a_ O
After B-IV
being I-IV
primed I-IV
by I-IV
Instagram, I-IV
users B-IV
will O
exhibit B-DV
higher I-DV
self-monitoring I-DV
than O
their O
dispositional O
self-monitoring O

H2b_ O
After O
being I-IV
primed I-IV
by I-IV
Pinterest, I-IV
users O
will O
show O
lower O
selfmonitoring B-DV
than O
their O

H3a_ O
Individuals B-IV
who I-IV
use I-IV
Pinterest I-IV
will O
display O
a O
more I-DV
positive B-DV
attitude I-DV
toward I-DV
a I-DV
brand I-DV
and I-DV
ad I-DV
when O
the B-IV
brand I-IV
is I-IV
advertised I-IV
with I-IV
a I-IV
product-oriented I-IV
rather I-IV

image-oriented I-IV

H3b_ O
Individuals B-IV
who I-IV
use I-IV

will O
display O
a O
more O
positive B-DV
attitude I-DV
toward I-DV
a I-DV
brand I-DV
and I-DV
ad I-DV
when O
the B-IV
brand I-IV
is I-IV
advertised I-IV
with I-IV
an I-IV
image-oriented I-IV
rather I-IV
than I-IV
product-oriented I-IV
advertisement I-IV

Therefore, O
our O
first O
hypothesis O
is O
as O
follows: O
H1: O
Differences O
exist O
between O
men O
and I-MO
women I-MO
regarding O
the B-DV
relevance I-DV
of I-DV
specific I-DV
gratifications I-DV
of I-DV
fitness I-DV
app I-DV
usage I-DV

Therefore, O
we O
predict O
the O
following O
more O
specific O
hypothesis: O
H2: O
Gratifications B-IV
that I-IV
are I-IV
connected I-IV
with I-IV
a I-IV
comparison I-IV
of I-IV
results I-IV
are O
more O
relevant I-DV
for O
men B-MO
than I-MO
for O
women I-MO

Based O
on O
the O
gender O
differences O
in O
gratifications O
in O
general O
fitness O
app O
usage, O
we O
also O
assume O
that O
the O
usage O
and O
gratifications O
for O
specific O
functions O
of O
mHealth O
applications O
(e_g_, O
voice O
coach O
or O
sharing O
results) O
are O
gender-specific O
and O
we O
propose O
the O
final O
hypothesis: O
H3: O
Differences O
exist O
between O
men O
and O
women O
regarding O
the B-DV
usage I-DV
of I-DV
specific O
mHealth O
functions I-DV

We O
thus O
hypothesised O
that: O
H1_ O
Online B-DV
troublemakers I-DV
will O
be O
more O
prominent O
in O
larger B-MO
online I-IV
networks I-IV

On O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
above O
findings O
we O
predicted O
that: O
H2_ O
Egos B-IV
reporting I-IV
incidents I-IV
of I-IV
online I-IV
trouble I-IV
will O
likely O
be O
female B-DV
and I-DV
younger I-DV
in O
age I-DV

H3_ O
Alters B-DV
exhibiting I-IV
troublesome I-IV
behaviour I-IV
will O
likely O
be O
male B-MO
and I-DV
younger I-DV
in O
age I-DV

We O
therefore O
predicted O
that: O
H4_ O
Online B-IV
popularity I-IV
will O
be O
positively O
associated O
with O
instances B-DV
of I-DV
negative I-DV
online I-DV
behaviour I-DV

It O
was O
therefore O
expected O
that: O
H5_ O
Offline B-MO
interactions I-MO
will O
moderate O
the O
relationship O
between O
Facebook B-IV
interactions I-IV
and O
instances B-DV
of I-DV
online I-DV
disagreement I-DV

We O
therefore, O
hypothesis O
that: O
H6_ O
Increased B-IV
instances I-IV
of I-IV
online I-IV
disagreement I-IV
will O
be O
attributed O
to O
significant B-IV
known I-IV
contacts I-IV

As O
a O
consequence O
of O
the O
above, O
we O
suggest O
the O
following O
hypotheses: O
H1: O
Social B-IV
image I-IV
impacts O
positively O
on O
the B-DV
perceived I-DV
usefulness I-DV
of I-DV

H2: O
Social B-IV
image I-IV
impacts O
positively O
on O
users’ B-DV
intention I-DV
to I-DV
use I-DV
F-commerce I-DV
platforms I-DV

Consequently, O
we O
propose O
the O
following O
research O
hypotheses: O
H3: O
Subjective B-IV
norms I-IV
impact O
positively O
on O
users’ B-DV
intention I-DV
to I-DV
use I-DV

H4: O
Subjective B-IV
norms I-IV
impact O
positively O
on O
perceived B-DV
usefulness I-DV
for I-DV
users I-DV
of I-DV
F-commerce I-DV

H5: O
Subjective B-IV

have O
a O
positive O
influence O
on O
social B-DV
image I-DV
for I-DV
users I-DV
of I-DV

Therefore, O
the O
following O
hypothesis O

We O

Thus, O
this O

Since O
social O

also O
a O
kind O
of O

we O
made O
the O

Hence, O
two O

therefore O
we O

the O

streams: O
(H|h)1a: O
Gubernatorial B-IV
candidates I-IV
will O
use B-DV
social I-DV
media I-DV
less I-DV
for I-DV
personalization I-DV
than I-DV
for I-DV
other, I-DV
more I-DV

H1b: O
Social B-IV
media I-IV
streams I-IV
will O
exhibit O
variation I-DV
across O
gubernatorial B-IV
candidates, I-IV
with O
some O
candidates O
engaging B-DV
in I-DV
more O
personalization I-DV
than O
others O

Second, O
we O
test O
the O
two O
hypotheses O
proposed O
by O
Strategic O
Stereotype O
Theory O
(Fridkin O
& O
Kenney, O
2014) O
as O
applied O
to O
personalization O
on O
social O
media: O
H2a: O
Male B-IV
gubernatorial I-IV
candidates I-IV
will O
engage B-DV
in I-DV
more I-DV
personalizing I-DV
communication I-DV
on I-DV
social I-DV
media, I-DV
presumably O
because O
they B-IV
perceive O
a O
strategic O
advantage O
to O
humanizing O
their O
image O
profiles I-IV
- O
or O
at O
least, O
perceive O
no O
electoral O
penalty O
for O
doing O
so O

Thus O
we O
propose: O
(H|h)1a_ O
Females B-IV
and I-IV
males I-IV
do O
not O
have O
difference B-DV
in O
the B-DV
expectation I-DV

H1b_ O
Females B-IV
and I-IV
males I-IV
do O
not O
have O
difference O
in O
the B-DV
perception I-DV
of I-DV
intrinsic I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV

We O
therefore O
propose O
H2a_ O
Females B-IV
have O
higher O
expectation B-DV
scores I-DV
of I-DV
contextual I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV
than O
males O

Thus, O
we O
propose: O
H2b_ O
Females B-IV
have O
lower O
perception B-DV
scores I-DV
of I-DV
contextual I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV
than O
males O

Thus, O
we O
propose: O
H3a_ O
Females B-IV
have O
higher O
expectation B-DV
scores I-DV
of I-DV
representational I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV
than O
males O

Thus, O
we O
propose: O
H3b_ O
Females B-IV
have O
lower O
perception B-DV
scores I-DV
of I-DV
representational I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV
than O
males O

Thus, O
we O
propose: O
H4a_ O
Females B-IV
have O
higher O
expectation B-DV
scores I-DV
of I-DV
accessible I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV
than O
males O

So O
we O
propose: O
H4b_ O
Females B-IV
have O
lower O
perception B-DV
scores I-DV
of I-DV
accessible I-DV
information I-DV
quality I-DV
than O
males O

Accordingly, O
we O
set O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H1_ O
Participants B-DV
will O
show B-DV
more I-DV
negative B-DV
reactions I-DV

It O
is O
hypothesized O
that: O
H2_ O

will O
show O
more O
negative B-DV
reactions I-DV
to O
npSNWs, I-DV
where O
the I-IV
information I-IV
contained I-IV
is O
not O
aimed O
at O

a O

than O
men; O
but O
not O
to O
pSNWS O
where O
the O
information O
contained O
is O
aimed O
at O
searching O
for O
a O

It O
is O
hypothesized O
that: O
H3_ O
The B-IV

the I-IV
individual, I-IV
the O
more O
negative B-DV
the I-DV
reaction I-DV

the I-DV
npSNWs I-DV
when O
used I-IV
for I-IV
selection I-IV
assessment I-IV
but I-IV
not I-IV
to I-IV
the I-IV
pSNWs I-IV

It O
is O
hypothesized O
that: O
H4, O
Participants B-IV
actively I-IV

will O
have O
a O

in I-DV
selection I-DV
processes I-DV
than O
those O
who O
are O
not O

Thus, O
we O
hypothesize: O
H1_ O

Thus, O
we O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
previous O
results, O
we O
posed O
the O
following O
hypotheses: O
H1_ O
Self-esteem B-IV
is O
negatively O

Facebook B-DV
intensity I-DV

H2_ O

H4_ O
Facebook B-IV

Therefore, O
our O
first O
hypothesis O
is: O
H1_ O
When B-IV

on O
Facebook, I-IV
people B-DV

Therefore, O
our O
second O

our O
third O
hypothesis O
is O
as O
follows: O
H3_ O

Therefore, O
our O
next O
hypotheses O
are: O
H4_ O
Online B-IV

be O
positively O

we O

two O

We O
thus O

higher I-IV
risk I-IV

Hence: O
H1: O

Thus, O
based O

The O

Therefore, O

In O

we O

as O

With O
this O

Thus, O
we O
develop O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
Hypothesis O
1: O
Online B-IV
public I-IV
self-consciousness I-IV
is O
positively O
related O
to O
perceived B-DV
ability I-DV

Hypothesis O
2: O
Institution-based B-IV

is O
positively O
related O
to O

is O
positively O
related O
to O
perceived B-DV
ability I-DV

Hence O
the O
hypothesis: O
Hypothesis O
4: O
Need B-IV

is O
positively O

Thus O
we O

Hypothesis O
5: O
Dispositional B-IV
trust I-IV
is O
positively O
related O
to O
institution-based B-DV
trust I-DV

Internet I-DV

So O
we O
hypothesize O
the O
following: O
Hypothesis O
6: O
Self-efficacy B-IV
is O
positively O
related O
to O
Internet B-DV
self-efficacy I-DV

Therefore, O
we O
have O
the O
following O
hypotheses: O
Hypothesis O
7: O
Agreeableness B-IV
is O
positively O
related O
to O
need B-DV
to I-DV

Hypothesis O
8: O
Agreeableness B-IV
is O
positively O

Hypothesis O
9: O
Agreeableness B-IV
is O
positively O
related O
to O
perceived B-DV
ability I-DV

Thus, O
we O
hypothesize: O
Hypothesis O
10: O
Conscientiousness B-IV
is O
positively O

to O
self-efficacy B-DV

Hypothesis O
11: O
Conscientiousness B-IV
is O
positively O
related O
to O
perceived B-DV
ability I-DV

Facebook I-DV

As O
introversion O
and O
extroversion O
lie O
on O
the O
same O
introversion—extroversion O
dimension, O
we O
hypothesize O
the O
following: O
Hypothesis O
12: O
Introversion B-IV
is O
negatively O
related O
to O
disposition B-DV
to I-DV
trust I-DV

Hypothesis O
13: O
Introversion B-IV
is O
negatively O
related O
to O
perceived B-DV
ability I-DV
to I-DV
modify I-DV
self-presentation I-DV
on I-DV
Facebook I-DV

So O
we O
hypothesize: O
Hypothesis O
14: O
Perceived B-IV

self-presentation I-IV
on I-IV
Facebook I-IV
is O
positively O

Hence, O
whereas O

perceived O
equally O
appropriate O
in O

Based O
on O
the O
previous O
literature, O
the O
following O
hypotheses O
are O
proposed: O
Hypothesis O
1: O
People B-IV
who I-IV
are I-IV
more I-IV
extraverted I-IV
will O
use B-DV
social I-DV
media I-DV
more I-DV
frequently I-DV

Hypothesis O
2: O
People B-IV
who I-IV
are I-IV
more I-IV
emotionally I-IV
stable I-IV
will O
use B-DV
social I-DV
media I-DV
less I-DV
frequently I-DV

Hypothesis O
3: O
People B-IV
who I-IV
are I-IV
more I-IV
open I-IV
to I-IV
new I-IV
experiences I-IV
will O
use B-DV
social I-DV
media I-DV
more I-DV
frequently I-DV

H1: O
There B-DV
will O
be I-DV
more I-DV
‘No I-DV
on B-IV
8’ B-IV
videos I-IV
than O
‘Yes I-DV
on O
8’ I-IV
videos X
overall O

H2: O
After O
the O
election, I-IV
there B-DV
will O
be O
a B-DV
greater I-DV
proportion I-DV
of I-DV
videos I-DV
posted I-DV
by I-DV
Prop I-DV
8 X
opponents I-IV
than O
supporters O

H3: O
There B-DV
will O
be I-DV
more I-DV
scripted I-DV
videos I-DV
before B-IV
the I-DV
election I-IV
than O
after O

H4: O
There B-DV
will O
be I-DV
more I-DV
professionally I-DV
produced I-DV
videos I-DV
before B-IV
the I-DV
election I-IV
than O
after O

We O
therefore O
propose O
the O
following O
hypotheses: O
H5: O
After O
the I-IV
election, I-IV
there B-DV
will O
be I-DV
a I-DV
greater I-DV
proportion I-DV
of I-DV
filmed I-DV
live I-DV
event I-DV
videos I-DV
among B-IV
the B-IV
“No I-IV
on X
8’ I-IV
videos I-IV
than I-IV
among O
the O
‘Yes I-IV
on X
8’ X
videos O

H6: O
After O
the O
election, I-IV
there B-DV
will O
be O
a B-DV
greater I-DV
proportion I-DV
of I-DV
extemporaneous I-DV
monologue I-DV
videos I-DV
among B-IV
the B-IV
‘No I-IV
on X
8’ I-IV
videos, I-IV
than O
among O
the O
‘Yes O
on X
8’ X
videos O

We O
thus O
propose O
a O
second O
hypothesis O
on O
the O
relationship O
between O
Facebook O
use O
and O
close O
ties: O
H2: O
Intensity B-IV
of I-IV

utility O
for O
individuals O
who O
otherwise O
have O
difficulties O
forming O
and O
maintaining O
both O
strong O
and O
weak O
ties O

This O
leads O
to O
the O
two O
following O
pairs O
of O
hypotheses: O
H3a: O
The O
relationship O
between O
intensity B-IV
of I-IV
Facebook I-IV
use I-IV
and O
bridging B-DV
social I-DV
capital I-DV
will O
vary O
depending O
on O
the B-MO
degree I-MO

a I-MO
person’s I-MO

H3b: O
The O
relationship O
between O
intensity B-IV

will O
vary O
depending O
on O
the B-MO
degree I-MO

H4a: O
The O
relationship O
between O
intensity B-IV
of I-IV
Facebook I-IV

will O
vary O
depending O
on O
the B-MO
degree I-MO

a I-MO

We O
call O
this O
concept O
“maintained O
social O
capital_” O
In O
keeping O
with O
the O
thrust O
of O
our O
prior O
hypotheses O
about O
the O
role O
of O
Facebook O
and O
bridging O
social O
capital, O
we O
propose O
the O
following: O
H5: O
Intensity B-IV

be O
positively O

H8: O
When O
there O
is O
a O
pattern O
of O
incongruent O
parent-child O
closeness, O
children B-DV
are I-DV
more I-DV
likely I-DV
to I-DV
be I-DV

their I-DV
mothers I-DV
only I-DV
than O
to I-DV
their I-DV
fathers I-DV
only, O
and O
this O
is O
especially O
true O
for O
daughters O

This O
perspective O
leads O
to O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H4: O
Irrespective O
of O
the B-IV
quality I-DV
and I-DV
stability I-DV
of I-DV
the I-DV
parents’ I-DV
marriage, I-DV
children’s B-DV
subjective I-DV
well-being I-DV

and O
highest O
when O
they O
are O

both O
parents O

In O
contrast, O
the O
balance O
perspective O
leads O
to O
the O
following O
hypothesis: O
H5: O
If B-IV
parents I-IV
have I-IV
a I-IV
positive I-IV
relationship, I-IV
children’s B-DV
subjective I-DV
well-being I-DV
