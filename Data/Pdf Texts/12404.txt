Abstract

Purpose — The purpose of this paper is to explore how Twitter is used as a political backchannel and
potential agenda setter during two televised political debates during the Norwegian election in 2011.
The paper engages with current debates about the role of social media in audience participation and
traditional media’s changing role as gatekeepers and agenda setter.
Design/methodology/approach — A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.
By introducing and using the IMSC multiple step analysis model on the Twitter datasets, the authors
are able to analyse the flow of thousands of tweets and compare them with topics discussed in the
televised debates.

Findings — The paper finds that the same topics are discussed on Twitter as on TV, but “the debate
about the debate” or Meta talk tweets reveal critical scrutiny of the agenda. The paper identifies a clear
pattern of political fandom and media criticism in the “debate about the debate”, indicating that Meta
talk in social media can function as a critical public sphere, also in real time, which has not been
identified in existing studies of Twitter and political TV shows.

Originality/value — The analysis is unique in the sense that the paper analyses a smaller, national
Twitter population in deeper detail than what is common in larger Twitter studies related to political
televised debates. The IMSC model can be used in future Twitter studies to uncover layers in the data
material and structure the findings.

Introduction

Twitter has within few years become a prominent “backchannel” for televised political

debates by making audience reactions visible online. By adding a specific hashtag to

their tweets, Twitter users can take part in larger, public conversations about an event,

reaching outside their own network of followers and followees to join the “virtual Emerald
loungeroom” (Harrington et al., 2012). The # character is used in conjunction with a

word or a phrase in order to connect the tweet to a particular theme. It allows for

coordinated distributed discussion on the Twitter platform. Hence, audiences can ASTD Journal ot

to TV shows become visible through Twitter, it allows for examination of the Twitter
users’ response to electoral debates in near real-time (Mascaro and Goggins, 2012).
Several studies (Twitter, 2012; Bruns and Burgess, 2011; Larsson and Moe, 2011;
Diakopoulos and Shamma, 2010; Elmer, 2013) have shown how Twitter has been used
as a platform for continued response sharing during large televised events, such as the
London Olympics, the Eurovision Song Contest or political elections.

This paper addresses how Twitter was used as a political backchannel and
potential agenda setter during two televised political debates ahead of the Norwegian
local election on 12 September 2011. We investigate to what degree the new arena
enabled by social media, particularly Twitter, facilitates a different agenda from that of
television, and how the Twitter users talk about the agenda and the debate. The paper
engages with current debates about the role of social media in audience participation
and traditional media’s changing role as gatekeepers and agenda setters (Hermida,
2010). By applying a multiple step analysis of the Twitter dataset, we are able to
analyse the flow of thousands of tweets and compare them with topics discussed in the
televised debates. The analysis is unique in the sense that we analyse a smaller,
national Twitter population in deeper detail than what is common in larger
quantitative Twitter studies (e.g. Conover et al., 2011; Bruns and Burgess, 2011; Jensen
and Anstead, 2013; Tumasjan et al., 2011).

The Norwegian case is interesting as the Norwegian population can be
characterized as early technology adaptors. Social media has taken a strong
foothold in Norway, where broadband access and use of media technology is among
the highest in the world. In 2011, 15 per cent of the internet population (which basically
is the whole population, as the internet penetration in 2012 was 95 per cent, according
to Statistics Norway) used Twitter (Enjolras and Segaard, 2011), while 56 per cent of
the Norwegian internet population used Facebook daily in 2012 (TNS Gallup, 2011).
We can therefore expect the Norwegian setting to be relatively advanced in 2011 and
the findings might be illustrative of wider phenomena.

Twitter and mediatized events

Since its launch in 2006, Twitter’s potential to challenge the role of edited media as
gatekeepers and agenda setters has increasingly caught the interest of researchers.
Twitter has gained international attention as a breaking news medium (Kwak et al,
2010), as a utility during crisis (Mendoza et al, 2010), as well as a backchannel for
televised events, such as Eurovision Song Contest or X-Factor (Highfield et al., 2013;
Lochrie and Coulton, 2012), political TV debates (Bruns and Burgess, 2011) and talk
shows (Larsson and Moe, 2011), to mention a few. Kwak et al. (2010) asked “What is
Twitter, a Social Network or a News Media?” They argued, based on a quantitative
study of the entire Twitter sphere in 2009, that Twitter is less a social network
(low reciprocity) and more a news medium as 85 per cent of tweeted topics have basis
in news links.

A typical finding in several of the studies related to Twitter and political debates is
that political Twitter use peaks during televised debates. When Bruns and Burgess
(2011) studied Twitter activity on the hashtag #ausvotes during the 2010 Australian
Federal Election, the three biggest Twitter peaks happened on days with significant
live televised events.

Similarly, Moe and Larsson (2012) found a clear relationship between mediatized
political events such as election debates and peaks in political Twitter use during
the Swedish general election in 2010. This tendency was yet again confirmed in theNorwegian study of Twitter use during the election campaign in 2011 by Moe and
Larsson (2012). Televised political debates drove up Twitter activity, in addition to
increasing the use of political Twitter hashtags outside the hard core of political
Twitter users. The increase in Twitter activity during TV debates can also be related to
humour. Several studies (Bruns and Burgess, 2011; Harrington et al, 2012; Highfield
et al, 2013; Holton, 2011; Larsson and Moe, 2011) have identified humour as a typical
part of Twitter exchanges related to political debates.

Furthermore, Mascaro and Goggins (2012) argued that Twitter operates as a
“geographically independent virtual town square” during political TV debates in the
USA, and that “a significant number of the syntactical features specific to Twitter such
as retweeting, @replies and hashtags are utilized to relay information, engage in
discourse and create new threads of discourses related to issues that are brought up
during the debate. ‘In that sense, social media tools can be vehicles for technologically
mediated civic engagement” (Mascaro and Goggins, 2012).

According to Hallin and Mancini’s models (2004), we could expect to find different
media usage patters in different geographic regions — often related to different media
systems. However, the findings in the studies discussed above related to Twitter and
political TV debates are surprisingly similar, independent of differences in political
culture, media cultures and technology environment. We could also expect to find other
agendas in social media compared to mainstream media, such as studies of blogs and
mainstream media have shown (Wallsten, 2007). In this context, we understand agenda
setting as “the ability of the news media to influence the salience of topics on the public
agenda” (Iyengar and Kinder, 1987). In their highly influential study, Max McCombs
and Donald Shaw concluded in 1968 that the mass media exerted a significant
influence on what voters considered to be the major issues of the presidential
campaign. Readers learn not only about a given issue, but also how much importance
to attach to that issue from the amount of information in a news story and its position
(McCombs and Shaw, 1972).

The longitudinal aspect of Twitter studies can set premises for some of the findings.
As we have seen in the #ausvotes study (Bruns and Burgess, 2011), independent
agendas from mainstream media are clearly found on the #ausvote hashtag during the
tracked time period of more than one month. However, when the focus of study is only
on selected TV debates during a very restricted time period, the Australian study
shows that it is less likely to find an independent agenda (from mainstream media) on
Twitter.

Based on these previous studies, we expect the Norwegian debate on Twitter to
closely follow the topics discussed in the televised political debate. Even if the general
debate on Twitter follows a different pattern than mainstream media, we expect
Twitter debates during live events to be closely related to what is broadcasted.
Therefore, our study predicts the following hypothesis:

H1. During televised political debates, the debates on Twitter follow the same
agenda as the televised debate.

In this paper we also want to look closer at how the debate on Twitter unfolds,
in other words how the Twitter users are debating. Thus, the content of the tweets is
the focus of this study, not the Twitter users’ political background or preferences.
In this regard, however, previous research gives fewer indications of what findings
we may expect.

Elmer (2013) has demonstrated how “micro-blogging sites like Twitter have become
key sites of ‘rapid response’ to live political events”. Twitter can be used strategically
by political parties, partisans and other viewers of the debate, as was observed in the
Canadian 2008 election (Elmer, 2013). Therefore, we can also expect the Twitter users
to challenge the agenda set by politicians and media in election debates. However,
we might also see Twitter used as a “technology of fandom” (Highfield et al, 2013),
where “established fan communities who would use social media to discuss the live
coverage” and praise, ridicule or criticize the broadcast.

In order to explore not only what Twitter users are talking about during the debate,
but also how and with what sentiment, we ask this research question:

RQI1. How are the Twitter users talking about the agenda and the televised debates?

The Norwegian context

The Norwegian election in 2011 took place in the aftermath of the tragic event on 22
July, when 77 people got killed by Anders Behring Breivik at the Utoya and in Oslo —a
majority of them children participating on the Labour Party’s youth camp at Uteya.
Totally, 11 of the killed victims at Utoya were candidates during the 2011 local election.
The tragedy happened in the early stage of the election campaign, and all the political
parties agreed to postpone the election campaign as the country went through a
collective mourning. The political parties agreed not to comment upon political topics
or criticize each other until 13 August. These rather gloomy circumstances are
particularly reflected in the first debate, when terror and security was one of the main
topics.

Televised debates between party leaders have become an important ritual in
election campaigns in democratic countries. In Norway, such debates have taken place
since 1961 (Allern, 2011). Previous research (Todal Jenssen and Aalberg, 2004;
Krogstad, 2004) has shown that TV debates have considerable importance for agenda
setting during Norwegian election campaigns. Furthermore, TV debates are produced
and staged by broadcasters, and political parties are adapting to the journalists’
premises and judgments rather than opposite, according to Thorbjernsen (2009).

Even though the 2011 election was local, the election campaign was partly national,
and the televised debates between party leaders were staged as national debates.
All the seven parties represented in parliament were present in the televised debates.
In the last debate, Rodt, a minor far-left party was also included.

Research design and methodology

In the 2011 election campaign, there were three televised debates between party
leaders. The first took place on 23 August 2011 and was broadcasted on both NRK1
and TV2, the largest TV stations in Norway. The two last ones were broadcasted on
9 September 2011 (NRK1) and 10 September 2011 (TV2). The two debates broadcasted
on NRK1 reached the largest audience and this study focuses on Twitter as a political
backchannel during these two debates.

For this purpose a thematic code book was developed and used for manual coding
of all tweets. There were two main categories of tweets; tweets about political issues
and meta tweets. Tweets on political issues were coded based on what political issue
they addressed (health, education, economics, etc.). Meta tweets were typically tweets
about individual politicians and the televised debate as such. Meta tweets were thencoded for sentiment. Furthermore, we propose the IMSC model (issue, meta, sentiment,
close reading) as a guideline for mapping Twitter debates, partly inspired by Wohn
and Na (2011).

To explain the coding in more details; the data were analysed in a four-step
approach, drilling down from thousands of tweets to close readings. First, we conducted
a comparative study of the issues discussed on television and on Twitter based
on quantitative content analysis. Totally, 15 potential issues were identified based on
analysis of party programmes and web sites. Grounded in the actual televised debates,
the initial coding was recoded into the major political issues in the televised debate
(terror, health and elderly, size of municipalities, education, economy, and transport).
In addition to these issues, the initial coding showed that several tweets did not
correspond to any political issue, but were other reflections about the debate or the
participants. This was named “Meta talk” in our study and defined as “the debate
about the debate”, which occurred frequently in our Twitter data.

The unique number of participants and share or retweets was also identified.
In addition, the time of the tweets were coded into five minutes time segments. This
allowed us to perform a comparison between the flow of the televised debate and the
corresponding debates on Twitter.

Second, as the study not only concerns what issues the users are talking about,
but also how the debate unfolds, “Meta talk” or “the debate about the debate” became
particularly interesting. We noted that Meta talk was reoccurring frequently in the data
material (about 50 per cent of all tweets, both in August and September, see Table II).
An inductive approach generated three subcategories of Meta talk based on what was
most frequently addressed by the Twitter users; politicians’ answers, media setting
and looks, grammar and body language. We defined “politicians answers” as tweets
about Twitter users’ comments on politicians’ arguments during the debate such as
tweets praising a politician for being really good in the debate. In the “media setting”
category we coded tweets related to the agenda (or the main topics), the TV format,
journalists’ questions, etc. In the “looks, grammar and body language” category we
coded tweets that commented on the politicians’ appearance or body language,
in addition to choice of words and grammatical errors. Humour is reoccurring in the
Twitter data material in both the debates, but we decided not to code it as an
independent category as it is often intertwined with other categories and irony often
challenging to classify.

Third, a sentiment analysis of tweets under the sub categories “politicians”
answers’ and “media setting” was carried out. As we wanted to explore whether
Twitter users were supportive or disagreeing with the politicians or how the media
setting was conducted, we further analysed the tweets in three categories: supportive,
critical or neutral. The supportive category indicated tweets that were positive
or praising of politicians’ answers or the media setting, such as: “In my mind,
@erna_solberg did a solid job tonight #heyre”. Similarly, the critical category included
tweets that criticized or disapproved the politicians’ answers or media setting, such
as: “One question the reporter left out: What will you not prioritize in the next
election period? #valg2011”. The neutral category included tweets that were mostly
nonaligned or uninvolved observations, such as “Heck, I don’t need to watch it,
I have voted early”.

Finally, the fourth step was a close reading of selected tweets, illustrating
phenomena identified during the previous steps. The relative manageable volume of
2,391 tweets in this study made it possible to code the total material.

Tweets and Twitter
users related to the
televised debates

The two television debates were recorded and coded for time and topics (H1). Data
from the Twitter stream was generated shortly after the events via Meltwater Buzz,
a commercial online media monitoring service provided by Meltwater. Data were
gathered as a meta search of several social media search engines. The advantage of this
meta search was that we could include several search criteria in one search including
both hashtags (#), @mentions and usernames. The number of tweets included in the
study is the total number of tweets generated by our search during the time-span of
the televised debates. The general reliability of Meltwater Buzz’ meta search was tested
by comparing Meltwater Buzz against the search engine Hashtracking.com. This was
done by designing pilot searches for specific hashtags using the two searching tools in
order to compare the results. This revealed that in situations where one tweet was
retweeted many times, the Meltwater Buzz search would not provide all retweets.
Consequently, we may have underestimated the number of retweets in our study slightly.

The search phrase included all Twitter names and real names of party chairs
(e.g. “Jens Stoltenberg” OR “@jensstoltenberg”), hashtags for the televised shows
(e.g. “#partilederdebatten”) and common hashtags for election debates (e.g. “f#valg2011”
OR “#valg11”). Partly due to the unclear hashtag convention, as was also identified by
Elmer (2013, p. 23) in a Canadian study, one hashtag could not represent all relevant
tweets during the televised debates.

The search results were exported to Excel spreadsheet and manually coded for time
and topics (H1), how users talked about the topics related to the politicians answers
and the media setting (RQ/). The sets of codes were exported to the SPSS statistical
package for quantitative analysis. Based on the results of this analysis, selected
Twitter postings were revisited for qualitative analysis.

Findings and analysis

During the first debate, which was held three weeks before the election, few of the
Twitter participants published large quantities of tweets. The average number of
tweets was 1.8 per Twitter user, while just seven had more then six postings.

The second debate was only three days away from Election Day and was much
more in campaign mood than the first and special debate in August. This was also
visible on Twitter. Both the number of tweets and Twitter users had increased.
The total number of tweets related to the second debate was three times as high as in
the first debate. In the second debate, eight to ten postings were not unusual, and some
Twitter users had more than 20 postings.

Except for the number of tweets per participant, the two debates confirm the same
pattern; broad participation in the Twitter debate and no domination by a few
contributors. Most tweets are original contributions, while one third are retweets
(Table I). Retweets can be compared to “liking” on Facebook, but a retweet is not
necessarily an endorsement, nevertheless, the user indicates an interest in the tweet by
sharing it further.

Tweets total 612 1,779

Retweets (%) 31 32The two analysed debates are also similar because they are part of the same election
campaign with the same party leaders discussing some of the same issues on main
national PSB channels. Social media was not promoted at neither of the televised
events, hence Twitter was not an official backchannel during the debates. Nevertheless,
the debates are different as they mark the start and the end of the campaign, the format
of the televised events were slightly different due to the prior national trauma, the
length of the debates were different, the issues discussed slightly different, and the
expectation of viewers were probably different — for the same reasons.

Similarities across the two debates

Differences in the Twitter debates might be explained by the differences in the
above-mentioned contextual variables. The similarities are, however, more striking
and we observe five key tendencies that are similar in both debates:

(1) The activity on our selected hashtags and Twitter user accounts increases
over time during both the debates (Figure 1). This indicates that the level of
engagement on Twitter increase during the televised debate.

(2) The share of retweets is similar (Table I). In both debates, about one-third
of the tweets are retweets.

(3) The topics discussed within predefined hashtags and user accounts follow
closely the topics discussed in the TV debate (Figures 2 and 3). The flows of
the debates are very similar with only a small delay in the Twitter debates
compared to the televised debate. There is no alternative political agenda
on Twitter during the televised debate.

(4) “Meta talk” — the debate about the debate — flows through both the Twitter
debates (Figures 2 and 3). About 50 per cent of the activities on Twitter related
to the televised debate are Meta talk in both events (Table II). Meta talk is
also one of the topics that create most engagement among the political Twitter
users.

(5) The share of Meta talk commenting politicians’ answers and media setting
is similar in the two debates (Table III). About half of the Meta talk concerns
the politicians’ answers whereas about 20-25 per cent of the Meta talk
concerns the media setting.

Meta talk in the debate
In order to facilitate a more in-depth discussion of the role of Meta talk in the Twitter
debate, we will first look at how Meta talk relates to topics and participants in the
debates. In the next section we scrutinize sentiments and attitudes (Figure 4).

Meta talk, “the debate about the debate” continues to rise gradually during the TV
debate in September. Here is one example of Meta talk in a tweet (all the quoted tweets
are translated from Norwegian to English by the authors):

Another Meta talk tweet picks up on a point mentioned by Kristin Halvorsen, party
leader of the Socialist Left party regarding politicians and the use of social media:

Kristin has a good point. Party leaders should answer on social media to people who have
misunderstood their party. #electionl1 #election2011.

Meta talk is reaching a peak at the end of the debate when many Twitter users are
evaluating which politician “won” the debate. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg (Labour
Party) and Knut Arild Hareide (party leader of the Christian Democratic Party) are

Table Il.

judged most positively on Twitter in both the debates. But the most common type of
Meta talk is humorous comments about the looks (i.e. appearances, clothes) or body
language of the politicians, such as this comment:

Tie winners: 1. Oddvar Stenstrem, 2. Jens Stoltenberg, 3. Knut Arild Hareide #election2011
#partyleaderdebate.

As previously mentioned studies have shown, humour is often found when Twitter is
used as a political backchannel. Ironic and sarcastic comments about arguments,
hairstyles and body language are commonly shared, such as this tweet:

In my view, tanning cream is used more and more in the election campaign. #election2011.

When education is the main topic during the TV debate in September, Meta talk
slows down and drops to the lowest point during the Twitter discussion. At the same
time, education tweets peak, indicating less distraction and more focus one the main
topic.

Reactions to politicians’ answers and the media setting

Even though the comments on Twitter closely follow the agenda in the TV debates,
Twitter users raise strong opinions, both supportive and critical, particularly towards
politicians’ answers and the media setting. In order to examine the sentiment or
attitude in the Meta talk tweets, we identified three main categories based on the data
material; politicians’ answers, media setting, and looks, grammar and body language.
Some interesting findings are worth mentioning; a majority of the Meta talk tweets are
discussions about the politicians’s answers, such as:

#partyleaderdebate @WTrinesg delivered as usual — looking forward to #election2011 on
Monday.

The same amount of Meta talk tweets are related to the media setting and looks,
grammar and body language, except in September. In that debate, tweets about
appearance and language increased because of particular outfits among the politicians
and much-debated grammar use (Figure 5).

When analysing the sentiment, we find that a majority of the comments about
politicians’ answers are supportive (related to the politician(s) they are mentioning),
both in August and in September. Particularly in August, the positive attitude is
strong as 57 per cent of the tweets on politicians’ answers are positive (Table IV).
The supportive sentiment continues in September, however, less dominant. The positive

we will return to in the discussion (Figure 6).

A big difference in the media sentiment appears between August and September.
While Meta talk related to the media setting is fairly balanced in August, 59 per cent of
the tweets are critical of the media setting in September (Table V). Many of the tweets
challenge the agenda of the debate, the moderators’ question, who gets to talk when
and for how long and how well the moderators are performing, such as:

Elderly, schools, roads — replay, replay, replay. Is that all #election2011 is about?.
I think the NRK-debate tonight should be run by the local NRK stations — with local
candidates, not the party leaders #valg2011.

Discussion

H1. During televised political debates, the debate on Twitter follows the same
agenda as the televised debate.

Our analysis supports HZ. The Twitter debate both in August and September followed
closely the topics discussed on television. There is no alternative political agenda in the

Twitter debate. The Twitter debates around specific hashtags and politicians’ user
accounts function as a political backchannel to the televised events, enabling users
to continuously comment the broadcast as if unfolds live. This is underlined by the
finding that even the flow of the debates are very similar with only a small delay
in the Twitter debate compared to the televised debate. By participating in debates
related to predefined hashtags, audience can turn television watching into communal,
social events.

According to aforementioned studies (Bruns and Burgess, 2011; Elmer (2013);
Wallsten, 2007), we could expect the Norwegian Twitter debates on election-related
hashtags to feature alternative agendas compared to mainstream media if the study
covered a longer time period. The very limited time frame of this study can explain
why the Twitter debates mimic the TV agenda so closely. Our analysis also confirms
that “compelling political TV events” (Shamma ef al, 2010) impact the debates on
Twitter. The data material demonstrate that the debate about education in particular
stimulated or provoked the most tweets, and simultaneously, reduced the number of
Meta talk, or what Shamma et al. (2010) describe as “chatness”.

The first debate in August was unique because of the tragic circumstances in
Norway at the time, which can explain the low number of tweets, as well as the high
degree of supportive tweets related to the politicians’ answers. The tone in the
televised debate was cautious and calm, which is also reflected in the tweets. In the
second debate in September, however, the Twitter debate appears to be more in
campaign mood, and we find more engagement and critical tweets, particular
regarding the media setting, but also more tweets related to politicians’ looks,
grammar and body language. Increased Twitter activity at the end of election
campaigns is a strong tendency in several studies about elections campaigns and
Twitter (Bruns and Burgess, 2011; Jiirgens and Jungherr, 2011; Larsson and Moe, 2011).

Even though broadcasting companies are defining the topics (and thus setting
the agenda) during televised political debates, Twitter users are criticizing, praising,
fact checking and making fun of the political events taking place on the screen.
We identified some clear tendencies when we investigated the data further, by asking
this research question:

RQI1. How are the Twitter users talking about the agenda and politicians in the
televised debates?

Meta talk — the debate about the debate — has an important function in driving
attention and interest around the debate. One can argue that off-topic discussions
about a party leader’s hair style or body language are of zero relevance, still, it gives
value to Twitter users following the TV debate, as this tweet indicate:

I love the combination of Twitter and #election2011.

Pohtical fandom and media criticism on Twitter

Tweets related to the politicians’ answers, the media setting and looks, grammar and
body language dominated the meta talk, and particularly tweets about politicians’
answers appear to be expressions of “fandom” (Highfield et al, 2013) — more
specifically “political fandom”. Even though this study did not examine the Twitter
users’ political background or which politician received most or least support and
criticism, recent studies (Elmer, 2013; Chadwick, 2011) have demonstrated how political
campaigns mobilize and encourage supporters to participate on Twitter during politicalTV events. In our material, Twitter users judge the performance of party leaders at the
end of the show. Wohn and Na (2011) also found that after a political TV event, people
engage in more opinionated discussions on Twitter. Somewhat surprisingly, a majority
praise or support the politicians’ answers in both the debates. “Political fandom” on
Twitter during live political TV events will depend on how successfully the political
parties are in mobilizing their supporters to participate in the Twitter debate.

A stronger criticism is found in the Twitter users’ sentiment or attitudes towards the
media setting. The co-production between the public broadcaster and the commercial
broadcaster TV2 was received very positively by the Twitter users in the first debate.
But particularly in the last debate, just few days before the election, many Twitter
users addressed critical concerns about the choice of topics and the journalists’
questions. Broadcasters might still be gatekeepers during rituals such as political
TV debates, however, Twitter audiences are expanding the conversation, giving live
feedback on mediatized events.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a number of insights concerning how Twitter is
used during televised debates in an election campaign. Through a multiple step
analysis using the IMSC model (issue, meta, sentiment, close reading), we were
able to identify not only how the Twitter debate aligns very closely with the flow of
the TV debate, but also how the Twitter debates supplement and contrast the
debate on television. The multiple step analysis started by comparing discussed
issues in the TV debates vs Twitter. Second, tweets discussing the “the debate
about the debate”, Meta talk, were identified. Third, the sentiments of Meta talk
tweets were analysed (mainly related to politicians’ answers and media setting),
and lastly, a close reading of selected tweets were performed. Our method is well
suited to perform in-depth analysis of Twitter debates, and we look forward to its
further enhancement.

Our analyses of how Twitter users are talking about two televised political events
demonstrate that Twitter not only provides a backchannel for reflections on the topics
discussed, but also a channel for proclaiming political support and critical comments
about the debates. Political fandom and media criticism were the two clear patterns we
found when we investigated the data more closely. Thus, Twitter can represent an
additional, if not necessarily alternative public space.

The “correction” to mainstream agenda setting often found in social media studies
takes a different form in our study. Through our analysis of Meta talk or “the debate
about the debate”, we have seen that Twitter users scrutinize the agenda set by
mainstream media and the politicians, and the discussion about the debate is equally
present as discussions about the political topics of the debate. This is a finding we have
not seen documented in the literature before, but which became manifest in our
multiple step approach. We look forward to future research that can explore in greater
details some our findings here, such as political fandom and media criticism identified
in the tweets. One approach could be to examine the sentiment of political debates
on Twitter in a longitudinal aspect. Future research could also examine the aspect of
political fandom on Twitter — who are the supporters and critics — “ordinary” citizens
or party strategists? By moving beyond big data approaches often found in many
Twitter studies, and rather dive into the details of political communication on Twitter
during televised debates, new insights into Twitter as a political backchannel
can emerge.
