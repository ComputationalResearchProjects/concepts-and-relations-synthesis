Social media such as microblogs (Twitter™) allow more people to disclose more personal and private
information more frequently to more others than ever before. But what is the nature of, and what factors
influence, those disclosures? Applying concepts from research and theory on self-disclosure research and
microblogging, this study analyses 3751 tweets, with nearly half including disclosures, over a three-day
period. At the user level, user-controlled boundary impermeability varied by user gender, feed identity
(parenting, social media professional), and their interaction. At the tweet level, tweet valence, presence
of disclosure, and front- or back-stage disclosure were variously influenced by user gender, Twitter feed
identity, interactions between them, and boundary impermeability. Social construction of gender roles
and social identities, as well as individual tendencies, and possibly communication contexts, are reflected

1. Introduction

Social media, such as Facebook and Twitter™, blur the lines between the public and private self, dynamically changing the landscape of communication and what we know about others and, in
turn, what others are able to know about us. Yet we do not know
much about this mediated disclosure. The Internet age offers multiple forms of presenting multiple selves, creating new opportunities for social scientists to study identity and influence, impression
management, social support, and other communicative behaviors.
Thus the goal of this study is to apply prior research on self-disclosure and microblogging to analyze the nature of and influences on
disclosures on the popular microblog Twitter.com by its adult
users.

In order to provide a conceptual and research background to
this study, the following sections highlight salient aspects of selfdisclosure (nature, privacy and boundary management, online
and social media, gender, and social identity), leading to a set of
hypotheses about how these are related to Twitter disclosures.
The review section is longer than typical, because we want to provide a good integration of related research and concepts in this
new area of mediated disclosure for both our own and others’ research. The subsequent sections describe the methods and results,
and discuss the limitations and implications.

2. Self-disclosure
2.1. The nature of self-disclosure

Self-disclosure, or the act of making new or secret information
about yourself known to others, has been a focus of social science
study since the 1960s. When Jourard (1971) introduced the concept of self-disclosure, he loosely defined it as “the act of making
yourself manifest, showing yourself so others can perceive you”
(p. 19). In 1973, Cozby conceptualized self-disclosure as personal
information verbally communicated to another person, including
descriptive information (e.g., one’s political party) and evaluative
information (e.g., how one feels about the election) that would
not otherwise be easily known or discovered. By this standard,
all communication includes some level of self-disclosure, be it between strangers or intimate friends. However, multiple definitions,
approaches, and operationalizations of self-disclosure exist (Altman & Taylor, 1973; Archer, 1980; Derlega & Berg, 1987; Wheeless
& Grotz, 1976). Self-disclosure is typically a gradual, reciprocal exchange process in which one person’s disclosure often prompts an
equal or even greater disclosure from the other person. Benefits include social control, validation, increased liking and intimacy, and
relational maintenance. However, it also makes hidden things
known, adding uncertainty to the relationship as “it involves the
risk of confiding in others, the responsibility of deeper awareness,
and the danger that one’s confidences may be breached” (Corcoran
& Spencer, 2000, p. 1; see also Baxter, 1988, on self-disclosure and
interpersonal relationship dialectics).1466 S. Walton, R.E. Rice/Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 1465-1474

In The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959), Erving Goffman used the dramaturgical terms frontstage and backstage to reflect the manner in which people adjust their personae and thus
their disclosures to the situation at hand. We reveal our public
selves frontstage before an audience and reserve our private selves
for backstage with confidantes. In the workplace, the majority of
communication is frontstage, and the information we choose to
disclose is what is socially comfortable and likely to produce the
desired outcome of agency, credibility, and influence within that
context. Backstage behavior - or more personally-orientated, private disclosure — is usually reserved for intimate interactions outside of the office, such as the home or a social event, where goals of
impression management and relational development may be quite
different than in the workplace.

2.2. Self-disclosure, privacy and boundary management

Communication privacy management (CPM) theory was developed to explain the process by which individuals choose to share
or disclose private information about themselves with others (Petronio, 2002). CPM has been applied to a variety of interpersonal
contexts (family communication, small group communication)
and issues (the process of disclosing private information about
medical mistakes, HIV/AIDS status, childhood abuse). More recently, CPM has been used by scholars interested in computermediated communication; for example, as a framework for understanding the disclosure of financial information at eCommerce
sites (Metzger, 2007).

Disclosure is both private and collective, with potential positive
and negative consequences for self and others. Once disclosed,
information becomes collectively owned and thus subject to multiple sources of coordination and control. Typically people adjust the
amount and content of self-disclosure according to whether they
are in a frontstage (public self) or backstage (private self) context
— that is, they attempt to manage the permeability of their privacy
boundaries. The term “boundary” is used in CPM as a metaphor
for the management of the balance between public and private
information.

2.3. Self-disclosure online

A general question raised in researching online disclosures is
the extent to which they differ from face-to-face disclosures. Rice
and Love, (1987) reviewed theory and research at the time that
proposed that due to the lack of richness or social cues of the medium, computer-mediated communication (CMC) disclosures were
somewhat limited when compared to face-to-face communication
(e.g., see Kiesler, Siegel, & McGuire, 1984). Their analysis of transcripts from a computerized bulletin board for medical professionals revealed, however, that users primarily shared non-personal
information, but a considerable amount of socio-emotional content, such as statements showing solidarity, appeared in the postings. More recently, the majority of a sample of MySpace
comments also had substantial (about two-thirds) positive emotion (and women gave and received more of them), while a third
had negative emotion (Thelwall, Wilkinson, & Uppal, 2010). Similar
evidence of CMC fostering socio-emotional as well as innovative
communication was also found in other studies (Rice, 1987). For
example, CMC increased self-disclosure by patients reporting intimate details of their sexual history, the number of sexual partners
and STD symptoms (Robinson & West, 1992). Joinson (2001) observed how strangers involved in task-based discussions via CMC
made more personal disclosures than dyads in the face-to-face
condition. Further, over-time, blog authors have “increasingly presented themselves by their first name and decreasingly by other
means” (e.g., nicknames or pseudonyms) (Herring, Scheidt, Kouper,

& Wright, 2006, p. 12). This represents the apparent comfort people have developed with sharing personal information on the
web where anyone can see it, and the diverse ways of doing this.
Papacharissi (2013) reviews how the “self’ has become more fluid
or processual, especially through online social media, which constitute “sites of self presentation and identity negotiation” (p. 207).

2.4. Self-disclosure and social media

Social media such as Internet forums, social networking sites
and blogs provide pervasive and continuous opportunities for disclosure, through message content, personal profiles, and shared
networks. The percentage of adult Internet users with personal
profiles on social networking sites has increased from 8% in 2005
to 65% in 2011 (Pew Internet and American Life, 2011). Nearly
90% describe their desire for friendship (connecting with friends,
making plans with friends, making new friends) as their primary
motivation. Many have multiple profiles, to help them maintain
different boundaries between their personal and professional lives.

Microblogging, or posting short status updates via social media
sites such as Twitter.com (which allows only 140 characters or
fewer per post), is quickly becoming a popular venue for online,
and near-continuous, sharing and often disclosure. As of May
2011, 13% (males slightly more than females) of online adults used
Twitter (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2011). Twitter has
become popular with an older, more educated audience, with
62% of its members over the age of 35 years (Quantcast Corp,
2009).

Sharing is one of the fundamental tenets of social media, so in
the culture of the Twitterverse, it is expected that messages will
be shared and rebroadcast. Boyd (2009) emphasized that while
many Twitter postings (tweets) may be banal, the purpose is
broadly social. Twitter users share varying degrees of private information about their current status. In turn, their followers or other
network members may respond to the messages either through the
public feed or with a private, direct message. On Twitter, users become the center of a unique social network, one in which reciprocity is invited but not required, and followers of a particular tweeter
may range from none to millions.

Microblogging’s asynchronous, one-to-many broadcasting has
developed many of the same characteristics of successful online
forums and message boards, resulting in an environment which
values self-disclosure over privacy. Twitter.com provides each
member with their own homepage, and the code to add tweets
to a website or blog outside of the Twitter domain. Popular applications have been developed for Facebook and LinkedIn as well,
and with the ability to post and receive updates from a mobile
phone, Twitter provides continuous awareness of one’s network
(O’Reilly & Milstein, 2012; see also (Rice & Hagen, 2010) for a review of this concept, such as perpetual contact, connected presence, continual co-presence, continuous partial attention, etc.).
Also, users can update their status on-the-go through mobile
phones, and perhaps this may make them more inclined to share
information more often.

Microblogging is a relatively new phenomenon and there are
few hard and fast rules for using the platform. Even in its short
existence Twitter has gone from a toy for social media geeks to
an important tool for mainstream media, politicians, corporations,
and NGOs, and a central means of keeping in touch with friends
and family (O’Reilly & Milstein, 2012). This is illustrated by the
changes in the Twitter home page prompt from “What’s happening” to “What are you doing?” to “Find out what’s happening, right
now, with the people and organizations you care about”. Thus,
gaps may occur between what is technically a public space and
how individuals define their personal blogs and social media networking sites as private (Child, Pearson, & Petronio, 2009). PetronioS. Walton, R.E. Rice/Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 1465-1474 1467

(2002, Chapter 5) argues that asynchronous communication may
disrupt the coordination of privacy management, leading to miscommunication at the time, or later conflict. However, microbloggers with some experience post tweets with a fairly clear
understanding of the public, collective nature of their messages.
Most Twitter users well understand the asynchronous aspect of
tweet communication (although the Twitterverse can diffuse hot
topics nearly instantaneously around the world; Kwak, Lee, Park,
& Moon, 2010), and may reduce turbulence through threads, retweets, links and other contextualizing factors, though many experience difficulties when first using Twitter or new feeds.

CPM uses the term “private disclosure” instead of “self-disclosure” to draw a distinction from Jourard’s concept, and focuses
on the private information disclosed. Thus the content of the
tweets sent by microbloggers on Twitter can be considered potential private disclosures. Users have the option to protect or remove
their messages from the public feed by changing the settings to
private, but most users keep their accounts on the default public
setting, while many explicitly include their Twitter hashtag on
public “follow” lists. Papacharissi (2013, p. 209) suggests that the
varying ways to control, or expose, various aspects of the self
through social media allow more user control over the gap between the frontstage and backstage, fostering different types of
discussions and impressions. Online disclosures may be employed
as tools in crossing boundaries to achieve frontstage impression
management (Dominick, 1999; Ellison, Heino, & Gibbs, 2006; Krdamer & Winter, 2008; Nardi, Schiano, Gumbrecht, & Swartz, 2004).
Social media encourage a higher amount of self-disclosure, and
thus more permeable boundaries, than what may be required or
socially acceptable in a face-to-face interaction.

Through Twitter, users manage the boundaries of the people
and disclosures they want to be exposed to, by following or unfollowing particular other microbloggers. Users with more impermeable boundaries may manage their privacy by being less likely to
post tweets that are negative, disclosive, or backstage in nature.
Twitter users may construct less permeable boundaries around
their messages by selecting the privacy option, limiting who may
follow or view their messages, following more people than are following them, and removing their messages from the public feed.
They may in turn expose themselves to others’ disclosures by
choosing to follow more tweeters. Users who keep the default,
public setting have in effect constructed permeable boundaries
around their social media self-disclosures. Selecting which feeds
to contribute to is also a form of controlling and owning boundary
management and related disclosures. Twitter users who broadcast
messages in one or more public feeds are making their followers,
and the larger public, co-owners of their disclosure, as readers
are able to “favorite” or save the messages of those in their
network.

Adults using Twitter as a networking tool for professional
development, microblogging with their true name and linking to
a clearly identifiable blog or website, run the risk of disclosing personal, backstage information to a wide range of unknown others
who may access, interpret, share, and respond to that content, in
ways that may undermine their efforts to cast themselves in a professional manner. The reader may, on the other hand, be aware of
only a small portion of the user’s online publicized self, depending
on choice of medium and access to the user’s different social media
networks (Papacharissi, 2013).

Likewise, adults using Twitter to facilitate backstage interactions with online peers, such as parent bloggers, or those who
microblog incognito, also run the risk of revealing information
which may threaten their cloak of anonymity or stimulate judgment from others sharing the same social identity. In studying intimacy on online dating sites, a disclosure topic of a backstage
nature, Baker (2005) presented the concept of hyperhonesty (or

the large amount of accurate self-disclosure in CMC - a subset of
Walther’s, 1996 concept of hyperpersonal communication), as her
research revealed that many romantic partners felt it easier to
share deeply held personal beliefs online. A study of the online dating site Match.com found that people used more self-disclosure
and were more honest in their self-disclosure when the other’s
identity was known, and that greater amounts, positivity, and
intentionality of self-disclosure lead to greater dating success
(Gibb, Ellison, & Heino, 2006).

2.5. Self-disclosure, gender, and social media

Derlega et al. (1981) believed that one’s gender plays a role in
the content of disclosure, due somewhat to gender stereotypes.
They argued that women favor backstage disclosures and the sharing of personal evaluative information about themselves, while
men tend to make more frontstage disclosures which facilitate positive impression management. According to Petronio (2002, p. 24),
“men and women appear to have distinct sets of rules for judging
how revealing and concealing should be regulated. . .. This is not to
say that they are precluded from coordinating those rule sets:
however, men and women may initially come to an interaction
with different visions of how privacy and disclosure work.” Early
studies of self-disclosure and gender (Cline, 1986; Cozby, 1973;
Rosenfeld, Civikly, & Herron, 1979) reported conflicting findings,
as some studies found men disclosed more than women, others observed women disclosing more than men, and still others concluded that men and women disclosed equally. In looking at
online romantic relationships, Baker (2005) found that CMC enabled men to feel more comfortable making intimate disclosures
to their romantic partners than in face-to-face communication,
while women’s disclosures to romantic partners remained relatively the same. Dindia and Allen (1992, p. 117) concluded that
there are minor gender differences in amount of self-disclosure,
primarily moderated by the gender of the target and by the nature
of the relationship or interaction. For example, when women had a
relationship with the target, be it romantic or platonic, they disclosed more than men. Although Nosko, Wood, and Molema
(2010) found that age and relationship statuses play a role in determining who will disclose, and how much will be disclosed, on
Facebook, gender was not a significant influence.

Thelwall et al. (2010) also noted that some blog research found
no gender differences, or even opposing results, but their own
analysis of MySpace emotional content (2010) concluded that, in
general (with variations by context and some cultures), women report stronger emotions, and state them more explicitly, exhibiting
more prosocial behavior (Hoffman, 2008), but also more vulnerability-related negative emotions (Brody & Hall, 2008). Particularly
relevant is research showing that women are more likely to share
their emotions in public spaces (Rime, Mesquita, Philippot, & Boca,
1991). A study of two sets of blogs indicated that the primary subject authored by men is something other than themselves, while
women use themselves and their own lives as their subject (e.g.,
are more self-disclosing; (Herring et al., 2006). (Stern’s 2002) ethnographic content analysis of young women’s (ages 14-17 years
old) websites revealed very intimate, backstage disclosures about
their lives, including narratives of loneliness, depression, and disappointment, as well as future dreams and hopes. Several feminist
scholars see the Internet as uniquely tailored to feminine social
interests and communication styles (Plant, 1998; Spender, 1995;
Turkle, 1995).

2.6. Disclosure differences by online social identity

Many microbloggers write or blog around particular themes.
We consider two social identities (Twitter feeds) that are likely1468 S. Walton, R.E. Rice/Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 1465-1474

to differ in influences on disclosure: social media professionals and
parents. This variation is particularly important because this study
does not analyze a random sample of tweets or Twitter users, but
tests a set of hypotheses based on prior research applied to this
new context. One recommended approach for reducing the limitations of a small number of cases is selecting cases to “represent the
full range of values characterizing X, Y, or some particular X/Y relationship” (Seawright & Gerring, 2008, p. 300). King, Keohane, and
Verba (1994, p. 92) recommend avoiding selecting cases on the
dependent variable and truncation of the dependent variable,
while including variation of the “key causal explanatory variable.”
Further, selecting a few such cases is appropriate to provide a more
detailed view or a framework for large-sample, more generalizable
research (Fearon & Laitin, 2008).

In general, those who microblog about technology tend to be early
adopters and proficient users of communication technology such as
Twitter. In addition tekhnologia, or the systematic study of technology as defined by the early Greeks, is commonly thought of as impersonal due to its primary focus of applying technology knowledge for
practical purposes. A subset of technology specialists, social media
professionals are well aware that information shared online is widely
and publicly available. They would also be more likely to understand
that while a tweet may be sent to a specific user or to their network
of followers in general, the tweet can be viewed by anyone with access to the Internet now or in the future. Thus it seems reasonable
that the social media microblogger who writes about their profession would both be comfortable in using Twitter yet may not disclose as much as other users about some aspects of their career,
family, relationships, or self. For example, sharing the trials and tribulations of job hunting might be considered backstage disclosure to
be protected from exposure to strangers.

Parent bloggers are a rapidly growing segment drawing particular interest both from other parents interested in learning and
sharing their experiences, and from marketers interested in promoting their products through online word of mouth. In 2009, parents made up 43% of Twitter users (Quantcast, 2009). Men and
women microblog about their roles as parents and share details
of their family life that in most cases would be considered private,
backstage information not typically shared with strangers. Unlike
professionals, who must worry about their career goals and their
professional self-presentation, family bloggers are freer from constraints of how they must appear. Fathers, in the context of their
home life where they are focused on child rearing, may have more
freedom to share backstage disclosures illustrating the personal,
emotional nature of familial relationships than they might in the
context of a work, especially technological, environment.

3. Hypotheses

Based on prior research on unmediated and mediated disclosure (especially gender, social identity, boundary permeability,
and extent and stage of disclosure), we propose:

H1 (User boundary impermeability). H1a. Males will have greater
boundary impermeability than females. H1b. Social media professionals will have greater boundary impermeability than parents.
H1c. Male social media professionals will have the highest boundary impermeability.

H2 (Tweet valence). H2a. Tweets by females will have more positive valence than those by males. H2b. Tweets by social media professionals will have more positive valence than parents’. H2c.
Backstage tweets will have more negative valence than frontstage
ones. H2d. Boundary impermeability will be negatively associated
with valence.

H3 (Tweet disclosure). H3a. Females will disclose more than males.
H3b. Parent microbloggers will disclose more than social media
professionals. H3c. Boundary impermeability will be negatively
associated with extent of disclosures.

H4 (Stage of tweet disclosure). H4a. Female microbloggers will
make more backstage disclosures than males. H4b. Parent microbloggers will make more backstage disclosures than social media
professionals. H4c. Female parent microbloggers will make more
backstage disclosures than male social media professionals. H4d.
Boundary impermeability will be negatively associated with more
backstage disclosure.

4. Methods
4.1. Sample

We sought approximately equal numbers of Twitter users who
were male or female, and who had identified themselves as either
social media professional or Mom/Dad microblogger. The subjects
for the study were identified via WeFollow, the top-ranked usergenerated directory of Twitter users, industries and topics. Individual and corporate Twitter users register at www.wefollow.com, or
send tweets to @wefollow, with up to three categories for which
they would like to register — that is, associating themselves with
a public identity, and making their tweets explicitly public. WeFollow represents occupations from nearly every field imaginable,
with over one million registered users. It lists registrants’ frequency of postings, the number of others who follow their tweets,
and the number of others whom the microblogger is following.
Seeking comparable samples across the four categories of gender
by identity, we used WeFollow to identify the 75 most frequent
posters from the “Dad” feed (997 registrants), 75 most frequent
from the “Mom” feed (5791), and the 75 most frequent males
and 75 most frequent females from the “Social media” (technology
professionals) (23019) feed. We explicitly chose the most frequent
bloggers within the two main categories as they are the most likely
to be comfortable with using Twitter, to understand the implications of social media disclosure, to have the most followers and
thus have their disclosures maximally exposed, and to allow analyses that distinguish between user and tweet influences. Note that
registrants explicitly chose to identify themselves by their feeds;
they may also identify with other feeds, but user names were unique across these two feeds.

Running an online computer script on the Twitter Application
Programming Interface, we captured 6705 tweets from the specified microbloggers over the first three days in March, 2010. This
period was selected because Twitter traffic increases dramatically
during the later part of the month when South by Southwest
(SXSW), an international interactive media conference, takes place.
Assuming that 5000 tweets would be a substantial sample for
hand-coding, a two-thirds random subsample was drawn from this
original set, providing 4470 tweets to be analyzed. Several hundred
tweets were removed due to unknown errors in the script, duplicates, or incomplete or uninterpretable content, leaving 3751
tweets. Also, because the 300 listed most frequent microbloggers
do not send equal numbers of tweets overall, much less by day,
these remaining tweets represent 187 unique microbloggers, not
evenly distributed across the four (gender by identity) categories.

4.2. Measures

Gender: Male or female microblogger is based on the name and
common sense cues in the user’s profile page and/or linkedS. Walton, R.E. Rice/Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 1465-1474 1469

website, as discerned by the user name, photo or common sense
information in the bio, user’s profile page and/or linked website.
Feed identity is either Parent (Mom/Dad) or Social media professional. Boundary impermeability is based on the number Followed (this tweeter followed by number of others), and the
number Following (the number of other tweeters this tweeter is
following), both obtained from the WeFollow site. Boundary
impermeability is the ratio of Followed divided by the sum of Followed and Following. Thus, the higher the percent from 0 to 1, the
more boundary impermeability. This measure represents the relative proportional potential of others being exposed to one’s disclosures. For example, someone who follows many others but has few
followers has a very impermeable boundary, providing proportionally little disclosure to others. Obviously this is not an ideal measure of boundary permeability, which, being personal and
contextual, would best be assessed by the sender or even as a relational measure between two people. However, this is not possible
in this analysis of Twitter data, though it does take advantage of
these system measures provided by WeFollow.

Valence is the general attitudinal tone of the message: negative
(—1) (dissenting, critical), neutral (0), or positive (1) (affirming,
happy, agreeing). Because valence is not fundamentally a tri- or
dichotomous concept, we used the continuous valence measure
of the mean across coders for each tweet. Presence of Disclosure
includes non-disclosure (0), which does not provide any specific
information about the tweeter, while disclosure (1) is a disclosure
about the self, expressing personal information of a descriptive or
evaluative nature. Stage involves either frontstage disclosure (0),
which is a message of impression management, or a message
meant to influence how others perceive them, and more public
in nature, or backstage disclosure (1), which is a message of selfclarification or self-expression, private information of a more intimate nature, including representations of emotional processes,
needs, fantasies or self-awareness.

4.3. Coding

We sought to have two sets of two coders code all the sampled
tweets, to enable tests for inter-coder reliability and coding of
remaining disagreements by consensus. Over two academic
terms, we engaged 8 coders, with 97.1% of the tweets coded by
A coders (the remaining tweets were coded by 1, 2, 3, 5 or 8 coders). This resulted in 14,988 separate codes for the 3751 tweets
by the 187 microbloggers. Coders were initially trained biweekly
in using and revising the codebook, coding using a separate pilot
set of downloaded tweets, and using the specially designed
spreadsheet template. Each coder was randomly assigned a proportional number of tweets from each of the 2 x 2 categories
but was not aware of the research questions or hypotheses providing the framework, to avoid bias (Orne, 1975). Subsets of the
downloaded tweets in the spreadsheet format were provided to
sets of independent coders each week, who then met biweekly
to discuss the codes, with ongoing assessment of the coding confusion matrix to clarify coding operationalizations. (If a tweet was
“nonoriginal” — that is, those 18% that contained a retweet, link,
forwarded query, location update, quotations, or lyrics - and if
it included the user’s commentary or other text, that portion
was coded.)

Table 1 provides example tweets for each coded category.
Agreement percent, and 95% confidence interval for the estimated
reliability, using the Perreault and Leigh (1989) formula for binary
data (as traditional reliability measures are inappropriate for 0/1
codes), for the four hand-coded variables, based on the 97.6% of
tweets coded by 4 or more coders, were: Valence (83.8%, 81.083.5), Disclosure (88.9%, 87.1-89.3) and Stage (90.9%, 89.1-91.7).

Disagreements were decided by coder majority; in the case of a
50% split, the code was marked as missing.

4.4, Analyses

By the nature of both microblogger behavior and the sampling
period, the number of tweets collected varied across individual
microbloggers. Thus at the tweet level of analysis, more frequent
microbloggers have more tweets in the sample, so for those
microbloggers, gender, feed identity, and impermeability ratio
have greater influence on the overall relationships and may be
auto-correlated. We report descriptive results from both the
tweet-level and the user-level. However, we use ANOVAs at the
user level data for explaining user characteristics (boundary impermeability), and at the tweet level for explaining tweet characteristics (valence, disclosure, stage). Each ANOVA includes the
hypothesized main, and in some cases interaction or covariate, effects indicated in the respective hypotheses. Because of the possible shared variance within users across their tweets, we also ran
multi-level models (using SPSS Mixed Models, ver. 20, with user
as the 2nd-level grouping and boundary impermeability as usermean centered).

5. Results
5.1. Descriptive

Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the variables, overall
and for both genders and for both feed identities. User-level data
show that the microbloggers are slightly more women (54.9%) than
men, belong largely to the social media professional feed (70.1%),
and have slightly over 50% boundary impermeability (a surprisingly even balance). Based on tweet-level data, 35% of the tweets
have positive, 57.9% neutral, and 7% negative valence; somewhat
less than half (46%) were disclosures; and only 6% were backstage
disclosures.

5.2. Hypothesis tests - ANOVAs

As Table 3 shows, over three-quarters (11 of 14) of the hypotheses were supported by ANOVA analyses.

5.2.1. User level of analysis

H1. User boundary impermeability. Both main effects of gender (H1a, men’s tweets) and identity (especially H1b, social media
tweets), and the interaction (H1c, men’s social media tweets), were
significant. Because of the significant differences in boundary
impermeability, and the relevant hypotheses, the remaining
tweet-level analyses include boundary impermeability as a covariate. At the user level, greater boundary impermeability is significantly positively associated with positive valence (r= .16, p < .05),
but not with disclosure (r= .05), or stage (r = —.05).

5.2.2. Tweet level of analysis

At the tweet level, greater boundary impermeability is not correlated with valence (r= —.02), but is significantly negatively correlated with disclosure (r=—.14, p<.01) and stage (r=—.06,
p<.01). H2. Tweet valence. Because of the smaller sample size of
tweets including backstage disclosures, we ran two analyses: one
without stage, and one with. For the first subanalysis, tweets by females had significantly more positive valence than by males (H2a),
but there was no difference by identity (rejecting H2b). Boundary
impermeability was unrelated to valence (rejecting H2c). For the

cant effects for both impermeability and stage (supporting H2c and
H2d).

H3. Tweet disclosure: Tweets included more disclosure by females (H3a), and by social media professionals (rejecting H3b),
and with less boundary impermeability (H3c). H4. Stage of tweet
disclosure: Tweets by females (H4a), but not by parents (rejecting
H4b), had more backstage disclosures. Female parent microbloggers made more backstage disclosures than did male social media
professionals (H4c), though the actual difference was due to fewer
backstage disclosures by male social media microbloggers than the
other three categories. Boundary impermeability was not associated with stage (rejecting H4d).

5.3. Hypotheses tests - multi-level models

Results of the multi-level models, Table 4, show that the random intercept was significant in each tweet-level model (e.g., valence with an Intraclass Coefficient of 10.1% or 10.7%, disclosure
with 8.0%, and stage with 6.7%). This means that the intercepts of
the dependent variables varied across users. Though this amount
of variance is small, it did reduce the significance of some of the
explanatory variables, so that about half (5 of 11) of the tweet-level
hypotheses were supported through this more rigorous approach.
The F-ratios in the mixed model results were notably different only
in the case of the greater influence of feed identity and boundary
impermeability on extent of disclosure in the ANOVAs, and of the
significant influence of identity on valence in the mixed model.
That is, the influence of feed identity and boundary impermeability
on disclosure in tweets is primarily a user-level trait, while the
influences on valence and stage are not.

6. Discussion
6.1. Implications

6.1.1. Boundary impermeability

While perhaps not the best measure of microblogger user-controlled boundary impermeability, the followed-to-total ratio indicates that users overall have a fairly even balance between

inward and outward exposure to Twitter disclosures, regardless
of their overall level of tweeting. As predicted, males, social media
professionals, and especially the combination, have more impermeable boundaries. Impermeability is associated with less disclosure, but not stage (though the number of backstage cases was
very low). The less one is relatively open to other tweeters’ content,
the less disclosing one is. Indeed, one possible explanation for the
lack of influence of the user level in the multi-level models — in the
form of rather low shared variance among tweets by an individual
user and the persistence of many of the significant influence in the
ANOVA analyses - may be that variance across tweet contexts is
greater than any consistency of individual style (except for extent
of disclosure). Indeed, Nguyen, Bin, and Campbell (2012) also rejected any clear relationship between channel and disclosure,
arguing for the potential moderating influences of factors such as
communicator relationship, communication mode, and interaction
context. Analysis of 2009 Pew survey data showed that online trust
increased, while perception of privacy risks reduced, the disclosing
of personal identifiable information (Mesch, 2012). Suler (2004)
identified six major influences on online disclosure (“dissociative
anonymity, invisibility, asynchronicity, solipsistic introjection, dissociative imagination, and minimization of authority”, p. 321), as
well as personality factors, so it is misleading to claim a simple
relationship between being online/offline and disclosure. In general, though, boundary impermeability is a substantively and
empirically important factor to consider even in mediated
disclosure.

6.1.2. Gender differences

Most of the differences in boundary impermeability, valence,
disclosure and stage followed expectations based on prior research and CPM. That is, females had more positive valence,
and disclosed more overall and more backstage material. To some
extent, then, tweets by females seem to reflect a societal gender
role as more nurturing and emotional, whether in the workplace
or the living room. Men’s role in society may not be as readily
accepting of public, especially backstage, disclosures and perhaps
this contributes to male differences in patterns of disclosure. Possibly men feel a greater need to manage their professionalTable 2

impression by limiting their disclosure, even in a public medium
such as Twitter.

6.1.3. Feed identity

However, of the three hypotheses rejected in the ANOVA analyses (H2b, H4b, and H4d) two were related to a lack of differences
between the two feed identities on valence and stage. Even though
boundary impermeability was higher for social media microbloggers, their tweets were no less positive than those by parents. Further, social media microbloggers disclosed more overall than did
parent microbloggers, and did not provide fewer backstage disclosures (though this is partially due to the small number of backstage
disclosures). This may be due to the highly constrained nature of
tweets, forcing users to provide focused, novel and even disclosive
content, or to the social nature of the technology topics being discussed by social media professionals.

6.2. Limitations

Given our theoretical concerns and constraints on resources, we
specifically chose just two feed identities, to represent as maximal
as possible theoretical variance in likelihood of kinds of disclosure
and interaction with the gender of the user, within a short period
of time. Along with the time-specific and frequent-user nature of
the microbloggers selected, of course this sample and the results
are not generalizable to other feed identities or microbloggers
(and perhaps even less so as the nature of Twitter continues to
evolve). The usual qualifications about causality might apply, except that gender, feed identity, and boundary impermeability are
all either fixed and/or prior user attributes, while valence, content,
disclosure and stage are based on tweets produced conceptually
subsequent to those attributes.

As the tweets analyzed here come from the public feeds established by their authors — that is, those intending and even advertising a public orientation — they cannot of course reflect influences of
or on less public Twitter privacy settings. Therefore the measure of
boundary impermeability used here cannot reflect more fundamental distinctions created by various privacy choices. For example, users who allow only close friends to follow them - that is,
have the lowest boundary permeability —- may well engage in more
backstage disclosure, possibly with more negative valence.

Further, this study does not assess how readers evaluate or respond to the disclosures. We do know, however, that publicly disclosed Facebook content (e.g., status updates and wall posts)
seem to generate lower perceptions of message and relational intimacy than do private (private messages) disclosures, and publicly
shared intimate disclosures are perceived as less appropriate than
privately disclosed tweets (Bazarova, 2012). While, as noted earlier, Twitter has become immensely popular (and in a very short
time), its meanings and forms have evolved since its introduction
- from interactive conversation to one-way information and mass
publishing - and are still in flux (Van Dijck, 2013). Twitter is
becoming more and more integrated within and easily linked to
and from other media, and conveys more mainstream content
(such as news feeds, celebrity updates, mass publishing). Therefore
its public/private combinations, uses, and kinds of disclosure may
well change too.

6.3. Future research

Larger samples and more detailed coding would allow for
description and analysis of types of non-disclosure (e.g., location
updates, queries, providing information), frontstage disclosure
(e.g., impression management, agency) and backstage disclosure
(e.g., emotion and emotional processes, needs, fantasies/dreams/
hope, self-awareness). Longer-term data collection would allow
for order/sequence effects, such as positive/negative responses
(backlash vs. support) to types of prior disclosures. Such over-time
data might identify patterns of evolution of online user disclosure.
Additional feed identities might provide more insight into levels
and types of disclosure. For example, health care providers might
be a type of professional category that supports/requires more disclosure in general and more backstage disclosure in particular. A
deeper analysis of the application of communication privacy management to mediated, microblog disclosure would involve contacting a random sample of the microbloggers, again stratified by
gender and appropriate feed, and surveying them about their perceptions of the boundary suppositions and privacy rule management processes associated with their coded tweets. Finally, there
are of course many other influences on men’s and women’s emotional tendencies, and thus their offline and online disclosure, such
as culture and gender-role expectations, linguistic affiliative orS. Walton, R.E. Rice/Computers in Human Behavior 29 (2013) 1465-1474 1473

7. Conclusion

The results provide good support for hypotheses about relationships between gender and Twitter feed identity on some mediated
disclosure and boundary management issues derived from interpersonal disclosure theory and microblog research. Differences in
mediated disclosure may be to some extent influenced by how
gender and online identity are socially constructed, and a balance
between individual traits and communicative contexts. However,
even the very constrained and mediated communication via Twitter reflects interpersonal propositions about disclosure and communication privacy management. Social media provide a rich
environment for applying and extending traditional communication theories and research.
