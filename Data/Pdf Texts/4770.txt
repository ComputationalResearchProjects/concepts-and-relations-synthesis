Abstract

Purpose — The purpose of this study is to understand the use of social networking sites (SNSs) by hotels.
Specifically, drawn upon a resource and capability-based perspective, this study addresses two research
questions: (1) the relationship between a hotel’s resources and its use of Twitter and (2) the relationship
between the use of Twitter by hotels and their RevPAR.

Design/methodology/approach — The research data include the hotel chain scales, Twitter user profiles
and Twitter activities of the hotel parent companies in the USA and the hotels’ RevPAR. To more clearly
understand the effect of the use of SNSs, the study uses two dimensions: electronic word-of-mouth and
customer engagement. The two dimensions of the hotels’ Twitter use are calculated based on the data
extracted from their Twitter user profiles and historical tweets. For a practical purpose, a social media index
(SMI), which combines electronic word-of-mouth and the customer engagement score, was used to determine
the overall level of Twitter use by hotels.

Findings — For RQ, the results indicate there is a positive association between a hotel’s resources and
Twitter use. For RQ2, this study shows there is also a positive association between Twitter use by hotels and
their RevPAR.

Practical implications — Twitter use appears to be associated with hotels’ resources. In turn, Twitter use
is positively associated with hotel RevPAR. Thus, hotels should look at Twitter as a potential strategic tool
for business operation and attempt to increase their ability to leverage Twitter (and other SNSs) for
organizational goals (e.g. sales, promotion, customer service).

Originality/value — To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study empirically investigating the use of
SNSs by hotels with the data drawn from actual firm-generated content (e.g. tweets, retweets) and hotels’ user
profile information from Twitter.

Introduction

Social media refers to a broad range of internet applications, including online review sites
(ag. TripAdvisor), social networking sites (SNSs) (e.g. Twitter) and content sharing platforms
(ag. YouTube) (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010). In recent years, social media, particularly SNSs,
has expanded rapidly in industries. Over 90 per cent of marketers have used such social media
platforms for their businesses (Bennett, 2013). According to an industry report, almost 80 per
cent of Fortune 500 companies employ Twitter and Facebook (Barnes and Lescault, 2014). Arecent Chief Marketing Officers’ (CMO) survey shows that companies are increasing their (Case of twitter

expenditures on SNS such as Twitter and Facebook by investing in technology and
infrastructure (Tadena, 2014). Facebook reached 1.65 billion monthly active users (Facebook,
2016), while Twitter claims to have over 300 million monthly active users (Twitter, 2016).

In recent years, the hotel industry has increasingly adopted social media, particularly in
the form of SNSs (Luo and Zhong, 2015), which play key roles in advertising, marketing and
promotions within the hotel industry (Kim and Park, 2017; Taylor et al, 2015). This trend is
also observed in tourism industries as festivals (MacKay ef al, 2017), destination
management organizations (Mariani et al, 2016) and travel agencies (Park et al, 2016) are
now actively utilizing social media. With social media’s increasing popularity, consumers
are expected to express or share their opinions and seek information on social media in the
hotel industry (Sparks et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2016). This increasing adoption of social media
has changed methods of interaction and participation in the hotel industry (Leung ef al,
2015). Among many different internet-based applications, SNSs (e.g. Twitter) in particular
are currently flourishing. A recent report on customer engagement technology shows that
Twitter is among “the top three” (1e. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) social media
platforms used by hotels in the USA (Leung ef al, 2015).

Although the hotel industry has significantly increased its adoption of SNSs, there is a
growing sentiment among businesses: while they increase investments (or resources) in SNSs,
they are wondering about the impact of such investments on social media use and business
performance (Tadena, 2014). Moreover, there has been relatively little empirical research on the
relationship between social media use and hotel performance (Kim ef al, 2016). As a recent
literature review (Lu et al, 2018) on social media in the hospitality and tourism industry during
2004-2014 revealed, many studies have paid attention to online review sites (e.g. TripAdvisor),
also known as user-generated content aggregators, and explored the impact of user-generated
contents, such as reviews and ratings, in the context of hotel performance (Anderson, 2012; Kim
et al, 2015b; Kwok et al, 2017; Xie et al, 2014; Ye et al, 2011). For example, Kim ef al (2015b)
reported that online reviews influence customers’ decisions and, subsequently, hotel
performance. However, there has been relatively little research on the SNSs form of social
media and firm-generated content (e.g. promotion) in the hospitality and tourism contexts (Kim
et al., 2015b). In turn, social media research in the hospitality and tourism areas lacks diversity,
and research on Twitter and other SNSs is limited (Lu et al, 2018).

This study is an attempt to fill the research gap in hospitality and tourism literature
by answering two research questions. The first research question deals with the
relationship between hotels’ access to resources and their use of Twitter. The empirical
findings from this question will reveal whether hotels’ resources are positively
associated with Twitter use. Second, the study answers the question of whether there is a
positive relationship between hotels’ Twitter use and their RevPAR. A resource and
capability-based perspective (Trainor, 2012) is considered as a theoretical basis. This
theoretical framework suggests that firms’ resources become the source of distinctive
capabilities, which are positively associated with business performance. In this vein, two
hypotheses are developed:

(1) the level of social media (Twitter) use by hotels increased with their access to
resources; and

(2) there isa positive association between Twitter use and hotels’ business performance.

This research draws upon the data, including the hotel chain scales, Twitter user profiles
and firm-generated content, of the hotel parent companies in the USA and the hotel parent
companies’ RevPAR values.

Literature review

Theoretical background

This study draws upon a resource and capabilities-based perspective (Trainor, 2012) as the
theoretical basis. According to this perspective, a firm is properly viewed as a collection of
resources, such as brand names, reputation, in-house IT knowledge, skilled employees and
capital (Wernerfelt, 1984). Organizational capabilities (or competences) can be generated
from such resources and, as a result, lead to competitive advantage. Organizational
capabilities are shown in different forms, including business processes (Teece ef al., 1997),
routines (Grant, 1991) and IT deployment and use (Bharadwaj, 2000). According to Grant
(1991), a capability is “regular and predictable patterns of activity” (p. 122), such as customer
service, new product development, advertising and technology adoption and use. In
technology contexts, Bharadwaj (2000) noted that IT capability is a firm’s ability to leverage
IT for organizational benefit. The adoption and use of organizational technologies, which
varies among companies, largely rely on firms’ resources (Caldeira and Ward, 2003). This
resource and capability perspective has been adopted in social media contexts (Trainor,
2012).

Within this framework, a hotel’s resources are an important consideration when
discussing its use of social media, as the adoption and use of a social media platform such as
Twitter is considered an innovative business practice (Leung et al., 2015), involving costs
(Paniagua and Sapena, 2014) and requiring investments in technologies, people,
organizational policies and other infrastructure (Jussila et a/., 2014; Michaelidou et al, 2011).
Continuous use of social media requires firm resources (e.g. technology, people and capital)
and coordination among organizational actors. In short, a hotel’s ability to leverage social
media largely relies on its resources, and a hotel’s use of Twitter for communication and
engagement is considered one of its capabilities or competencies. For example, customers
follow popular brands in Twitter (Chu and Sung, 2015), and thus, hotel brand image is
considered a key organizational resource affecting a hotel’s Twitter use or its ability to
leverage Twitter for organizational goals (e.g. sales, promotion and customer service). In this
vein, hotels with large numbers of brand followers are likely to achieve their goals better
than those with fewer followers.

Social media use
Social media has evolved at a fast pace in recent years, and there are many forms of social
media (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2010). This study focuses on SNSs whose popularity has
surged, as many businesses and customers have adopted Twitter and Facebook. Social
media platforms vary by their “affordances”. While online review sites (e.g. TripAdvisor),
which have been extensively studied in the hospitality and tourism management (Lu et al,
2018), mainly host user-generated content, Twitter and other SNS provide both usergenerated and firm-generated content (Noone et al., 2011). Thus, two dimensions of Twitter
use deserve extra attention: electronic word-of-mouth and engagement with customers.
Word-of-mouth (WOM) is a popular term to describe the social fabric of information
diffusion among customers, and the influence such information has on purchasing decisions
and brand recognition. WOM is spread through the internet nowadays and is broadly
known as eWOM (King ef al, 2014). Using web technologies (e.g. blogs, review sites),
potential customers can now seek advice and information about products from outside their
own networks (e.g. close friends). Lately, SNS has expanded the impact of eWOM through
the virality of information available via online networks (Litvin et al, 2018). People and
organizations are connected through such things as friendship in Facebook and follower
relationships in Twitter. Information can be viral through this type of online relationship.For example, posting reviews and opinions on social media was well-documented by a tweet
about the financial markets. In 2013, the Associated Press’ Twitter account was hacked and
7 million followers’ responses to reports about a White House explosion appeared on the
company’s Twitter feed. In response, the US stock market fell sharply within a few seconds,
and the Dow Jones dropped more than 100 points within a few minutes.

As the hospitality and tourism fields generate intangibles that are often associated with
luxury, customers tend to be risk-averse when choosing a hotel provider (Leung et al., 2013).
In this context, studies have examined how eWOM influences prospective customers’
decisions on room purchases, which subsequently affect hotel performance. Several studies
have focused on online customer review sites and the effects of user-generated content
(e.g. customer reviews) on different performance measures (Cheng and Loi, 2014). The
general findings of such studies suggest that the valence and volume of online customer
reviews have a significant impact on hotels’ financial performance.

The importance of engagement with customers has long been recognized in hotel
literature. Such efforts by hotels are often discussed in the context of customer relationship
management (CRM). This customer engagement often takes two forms: responsive and
proactive. Management responses can not only address service-related issues and help the
company recover from service failures (Barsky and Frame, 2009), but also increase customer
satisfaction by addressing service failures in a timely manner (Ye, 2014). In the service field,
it is difficult to achieve consistent service quality (Levy ef al., 2013); management responses
to service failures have influenced customers’ future behavioral intentions (Vermeulen and
Seegers, 2009). The extant literature on online customer reviews and hotel performance also
provides an understanding of the role of a firm’s engagement with customers and its impact
on financial performance. The overall findings (Kim et al, 2015b; Xie et al., 2014) suggest
that the quantity of management responses affects hotel performance.

Some hotel marketers have become proactive in engaging with customers. SNS could
potentially enable greater proactive engagement with customers. For example, hotels are
initiating conversations with potential customers through original tweets or posts, in which
they ask customers about their experiences, opinions and ideas, rather than passively
responding to questions from customers. Also, hotel management addresses the issues and
concerns of specific customers and thanks them for positive comments. This type of
engagement is enabled through firm-generated content via Twitter and Facebook. Finally,
hotel management can engage with consumers by sharing customers’ tweets or posts to
strengthen relationships, as well as brand image. Thus, by taking a firm’s perspective, in
this study customer engagement is a hotel’s ability to leverage Twitter to respond to
customers, as well as to proactively engage with customers using firm-generated content.

Hypothesis development

As a primary example of SNS, Twitter enables real-time, flexible communication through
original tweets, replies and retweets. In addition, the Twitter site hosts content that can be
easily accessed in various ways, including active keyword searches and following other
users (Zhang et al, 2011). Specifically, Twitter provides certain features that can enable
greater eWOM, as well as effective customer relationship management. For example,
Twitter’s following feature enables relationship formation among potential customers and
hotels. Through this relationship in the Twitter sphere, product- and brand-related
information spreads rapidly and has the potential to become viral. Many examples of largescale eWOM distribution have occurred in this context (Sakaki et a/., 2010), including in the
hotel industry (Mendez, 2010).

Electronic WOM and engagement with customers, using Twitter and other SNSs, rely on
hotels’ resources. The literature shows that the business use of social media requires firm
resources and can be expensive (Jussila et al., 2014; Michaelidou ef al., 2011; Paniagua and
Sapena, 2014). Social media adoption is considered adoption of innovation, which faces
several perceived barriers including lack of financial and human resources and
unfamiliarity with new technologies (Michaelidou ef al, 2011).

Active use of social media by hotels could be more challenging than adopting social
media. Social media adoption itself may be less expensive. However, using social media
for business purposes, such as marketing and engagement, requires investments in
technological, financial and organizational resources, such as subscribing to social
media management tools (e.g. Hootsuite), hiring a team responsible for social media
communication and establishing organizational policies and procedures for
disseminating information (e.g. promotion) and responding to customer requests and
complaints (Jussila ef al., 2014; Paniagua and Sapena, 2014). Thus, a hotel’s use of social
media could be affected by its access to resources, its level of innovativeness and its
size (Michaelidou et al., 2011). Taylor et al. (2015) examined the impact of Twitter use
between two types of hotels (midrange and luxury) on customers’ purchasing decisions.
Their findings suggest that luxury hotels are more active on Twitter than midrange
hotels because the hotels with greater access to resources (e.g. brand names) are more
popular and more engaged in the Twitter sphere than those with less.

H1. The level of social media use by hotels increases with their access to
resources.

Effectively managing and using Twitter and other SNS is considered organizational
capabilities or competence. From the resource and capabilities-based perspective,
organizational capabilities are positively associated with organizational performance and
there is strong empirical evidence for that relationship (Fainshmidt ef al., 2016). Many
studies on online reviews (Kwok et al, 2017) show that hotels with “processes” or
“routines” on timely responses to customer online reviews experience positive financial
performance. Also, studies in social media marketing suggest a positive relationship
between the investment in social media and organizational performance. Schniederjans
et al. (2013) investigated the relationships between social media (e.g. blogs, forums
and corporate websites) and financial performance using impression management
perspective. Their study suggested that social media usage has a positive association
with firm financial performance.

In Twitter contexts, scholars have found that the use of Twitter is associated with
positive corporate financial performance. Jasen et al. (2009) showed that customers use this
social media tool to share opinions on brands and to disseminate eWOM. According to Gong
et al. (2014), in an investigation of the relationship between Twitter use and product sales, a
firm’s tweets and influential retweets exerted a significant effect on sales. Paniagua and
Sapena (2014) also examined the effects of social media on corporate financial performance
and revealed social media’s positive influence (by way of followers in Twitter and likes in
Facebook) on financial performance. They note that Twitter would be more effective than
Facebook in increasing financial performance. In accordance with the resource and
capabilities-based perspective and the extant studies on the impact of social media on
business performance, it is posited:

H2. There is a positive association between Twitter use and hotels’ business
performance.Methodology

Sample and data collection

Data collection began with acquiring information from Smith Travel Research (STR)
regarding the 129 hotel parent companies in the USA. This list was used to identify the
Twitter use name for each of the hotel parent companies; 113 hotels maintained Twitter user
accounts, while the other 16 hotel parent companies had no presence in the Twitter sphere.
The hotel chain scales (e.g. upscale, luxury), also borrowed from STR, were used to divide
129 hotels into four groups (luxury, upscale, midsize and economy) in terms of the level of
hotels’ access to resources.

The level of social media use by hotels was extracted from the 113 hotels’ Twitter user
profiles and actual tweets. Python programming scripts were written to access Twitter
Application Program Interface (API) and collect the data in April 2016. Twitter API, a
program protocol, allows researchers and businesses to collect tweets and metadata (e.g.
user profiles) using search keywords (or hashtags), user account names or random
sampling. To access Twitter API, Twitter API credentials are required from https://apps.
twitter.com.

A Twitter user profile includes a description of the user, his or her profile age, number of
followers (both individuals and groups) and other user information. For the actual tweets,
text processing methods, such as Regular Expression, were used to automatically extract
the number of mentions and retweets by each hotel, which indicates the level of customer
engagement by the hotels.

Finally, the hotels’ RevPAR were collected from the hotels’ annual reports available on
the internet. This online search resulted in collecting the RevPAR value of 25 hotel parent
companies that currently use Twitter. Although initially these numbers may seem
insignificant, compared to larger studies, the sample sizes were, in fact, statistically
sufficient because they were above the minimum required to achieve necessary accuracy at
the 0.05 level and to attain the hypothesized effect size for the analysis utilized (Cohen, 1992).

Variable definition

In accordance with the proposed conceptual model, three variables are considered:
organizational resources, social media use (or capabilities) and hotel performance (RevPAR).
First, in terms of hotels’ organizational resources, the hotel chain scales (e.g. luxury, upscale)
from STR were used as the measure for hotels’ access to resources, with the assumption that
the hotels in the high hotel chain scales (e.g. luxury) are those with more resources than
those in the low scales (e.g. economy).

Second, social media use was modeled as reflective of two dimensions: eWOM and
engagement with customers. These two dimensions were measured using data from the
Twitter user profiles and actual tweets of hotel parent companies. For practical use, the
scores of these dimensions are combined to create an index, Social Media Index (SMI),
representing the overall level of Twitter use by the hotel parent companies. Table I provides
a summary of the variables and measurements used in this study.eWOM represents the
potentiality of hotels’ messages to be spread to customers. This dimension was measured
through three items: number of followers, growth in number of followers and number of
lists. For example, the number of followers tends to determine the potential virality of a
hotel’s promotional tweet in the Twitter sphere. The promotional tweet of a hotel, with a
large number of followers, is expected to be more effective than that of a hotel with fewer
followers.

Three values from Twitter user profiles — follower counts, follower growth and list
counts — were used to gauge the escalation of eWOM. In our study, follower count refers to

the number of Twitter users following a hotel. Follower count was used to measure eWOM
in previous studies (Bakshy et al, 2011; Cha et al, 2010; Paniagua and Sapena, 2014).
Follower growth was calculated by dividing follower count by the number of months since
the hotel had joined Twitter. This item was borrowed from a previous study (Lee et al,
2013), which analyzed the relationship between Fortune 500 companies’ Twitter use and
their corporate social responsibility ratings. Finally, list count was the number of Twitter
lists on which the hotels’ tweets have appeared. A Twitter list[1] allows people to follow
interesting Twitter accounts and their messages. While follower count has been the de-facto
item for eWOM, list count, as a relatively new feature in Twitter, it is also considered an
important eWOM indicator, as it shows the popularity of a user. As a group, these three item
values were expected to measure the degree of potential eWOM power of each hotel parent
company. These values were distributed in a skewed manner, so they were logarithmically
transformed.

Next, to measure the extent to which hotels engage with customers in Twitter, firmgenerated content, such as tweets, retweets and mentions are considered. On online review
sites, such as TripAdvisor, the primary content generator is customers, and hotel staffs are
limited in that they can only respond to customer reviews (e.g. negative comments). In
contrast, Twitter provides more options. For example, hotel marketers are able to initiate
conversations with existing or potential customers using tweets, respond to customers using
mentions and build their brands among followers using vetweets. This dimension looks at
how active hotel parent companies are in the Twitter sphere through firm-generated content.
Three item values were used: status count, mention count and retweet count. They
measured the degree of a user’s Twitter activity in previous studies (Cha et al., 2010). Status
count refers to the total number of tweets from each hotel’s Twitter account. For instance,
one hotel responded to a customer’s complaint regarding a billing error: “@Kevin hi, as
already confirmed, the deposit was already released back to your account, the hotel offered
to refund your last stay”. In this tweet, @Kevin is considered a mention. Another hotel sent
out a tweet “RT @Mike: @Accorhotels joins Climate Camp. Growing vegetables and
changing menu. https://t.co/v Y4zyfftim #Hotels #Travel”. In this example, the hotel (Accor
Hotels) retweeted Mike’s original tweet, which positively describes the hotel’s green
initiative. This retweet appears for all the hotel’s followers. Regular expression, a popular
technique for finding patterns in texts, was used to automatically extract mention count andretweet count from the actual tweets generated between January and April of 2016. For
example, a regex ((?<=@)\w-+) in the Python programming environment identifies any
tweets containing the @ symbol as a mention. These three values — tweet counts, retweet
counts and mention counts — were logarithmically transformed.

Finally, for a practical purpose, the SMI of each hotel was calculated by the sum of
eWOM and customer engagement scores. This index intends to show the overall level of
Twitter use by a hotel. A hotel’s business performance was measured by RevPAR, a
commonly accepted business performance measure for hotels. RevPAR was calculated as
the revenue per available room (a hotel’s ADR x occupancy).

Analysis

To test Hi, the hotel parent companies were categorized in terms of their access to
organizational resources. The hotel chain scales from STR rely on the actual average room
rates to categorize hotels into one of seven group categories: luxury, upper upscale, upscale,
upper midrange, midrange, economy and independent hotels. The hotels that charge high
average room rates are expected to have greater resources than those that charge lower than
average room rates. Testing H7 involved dividing the sample of 129 hotels into four groups:
luxury group (luxury chains), upscale group (upper upscale chains and upscale chains),
midscale group (upper midscale chains and midscale chains) and economy group (economy
chains). The hotels in the independent category were excluded from this test, as these hotels
are not on STR’s list of the hotel parent companies.

To test H2, 25 hotel parent companies, whose RevPAR values are available on the
internet, were divided into two groups (i.e. high and low) in terms of their degree of Twitter
use. First, in terms of eWOM value, 14 and 11] hotels were assigned to the high eWOM group
(above the average score, 9.13) and the low eWOM group (below the average score),
respectively. Next, in terms of customer engagement, 16 and 9 hotels were assigned to the
high customer engagement group (above the average score, 7.62) and the low customer
engagement group (below the average score), respectively. The SMI value, which is
determined by combining eWOM and customer engagement scores, was used to separate
the hotels with high social media use from those with low social media use. 14 and 11 hotels
were assigned to the high social media use group (above the average score, 16.14) and the
low social media use group (below the average score), respectively.

Results

Relationship between hotel’s resources and social media use

MANOVA was used to test H7. The hypothesis states that the greater access hotels have to
resources, the higher their social media use is. The hotels were divided into four groups,
based on the hotel chain scales from STR: luxury (i.e. luxury chains), upscale (1.e. upper
upscale chains and upscale chains), midscale (.e. upper midscale chains and midscale
chains) and economy (i.e. economy chains). MANOVA tests whether there is a significant
difference among those four groups of hotels with respect to social media use. Table II
summarizes the test results. A significant effect was found (Wilks’s A = 0.730, F = 6.133,
pb < 0.001). Follow-up univariate analysis of variance shows there is a statistical difference in
eWOM (F(3, 109) = 12.27, p < 0.001, n” = 0.253), customer engagement (F(3, 109) = 11.43,
p = 0.001, 7? = 0.239) and SMI (F(3, 109) = 328.26, p < 0.001, 7 = 0.267).

As a follow-up, a Bonferroni post-hoc test was performed (Table III). With respect to
eWOM and SMI, the test results showed that the luxury group was significantly different
from the economy group (p < 0.001), but not from the other two groups (upscale and
midsize) (b >0.05). The upscale group’s eWOM was significantly different from the

with respect to CE.

Relationship between social media use and RevPAR

To test H2, the data were analyzed using an independent-sample t-test. Table IV shows the
results of H2. First, the results showed that there was a significant difference in hotel
RevPAR between the two groups (high and low eWOM) (¢ (23) = 2.22; p < 0.05, 7” = 0.177).
More specifically, the high eWOM group experienced a significantly higher RevPAR
(M = 147.44, SD = 98.84) than the low eWOM group (MV = 78.64, SD = 28.66). The results
also showed a significant difference in hotel RevPAR between the high and low groups in
terms of customer engagement (¢ (23) = 2.24; p < 0.05, n? = 0.119). The hotel parent
companies with high customer engagement experienced a significantly higher RevPAR
(M = 138.13, SD = 95.70) than those with low customer engagement (MV = 78.91, SD = 30.60).
Finally, the results showed a significant difference in hotel RevPAR between the hotel
parent companies with high Twitter use and those with low Twitter use (¢ (23) = 2.31; p <
0.05, 7” = 0.266). More specifically, the group with high SMI experienced a significantly
higher RevPAR (MV = 155.04, SD = 101.10) than the group with low SMI (MV = 81.07, SD =
34.11). Thus, H2 was supported.Case of twitter

Discussion and conclusion

Conclusions

Due to social media having become an essential tool in the hotel industry, for marketing,
advertising and customer service, there have been an increasing number of studies on this
topic. However, they have focused primarily on online review sites (e.g. TripAdvisor, hotels.
com) and other user-generated content aggregators (Kwok ef al., 2017). There have been few
empirical studies on SNSs (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) in the hotel contexts (Lu et al., 2018).
Drawn from a resources and capabilities-based perspective, this study is to explore (1) the
relationship between firms’ access to resources and SNS use and (2) the relationship between
SNS use and performance in the hotel industry. Twitter was chosen for this study because of
its growing popularity in both business and society in general (Kessler, 2010; Park ef al,
2016; Taylor et al., 2015).

Question 1 addressed the relationship between hotels’ resources and social media use. As
social media use is an innovative business practice (Leung et al., 2015) requiring bundling of
firm resources, hotels’ resources are expected to influence the adoption and use of social
media. For Question 2, the hotels were divided into two groups (high and low) in terms of
SMI. The RevPAR value of the two groups was compared. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to empirically investigate the use of SNSs by hotel marketers utilizing data drawn
from actual firm-generated content and hotels’ profile information from Twitter. The extant
literature emphasizes the positive role of social media use on business performance (Gong
et al., 2014; Paniagua and Sapena, 2014). Similarly, this study found a positive association
between the level of social media use and hotel performance. In this research, we viewed
social media use as organizational capability and considered two dimensions (i.e. eWOM
and customer engagement). For practical purposes, the combined scores (social media index,
SMI) of these two dimensions were used to measure hotel chains’ overall level of social
media use.

The findings related to H7 showed that social media use by luxury, upscale and midrange hotels was significantly higher than that of economy hotels. Organizational
initiatives, such as adoption of new technologies and business practices, require resources.
Therefore, the hotels with greater resources appeared to be more active in the Twitter sphere
and more influential and engaged than those with fewer resources. However, the results also
indicated that there was no statistical significance in social media use by the three groups ofhotels (ie. luxury, upscale and midrange). This may suggest that the adoption and
continuing use of social media platforms by hotels is less resource-intensive than more
complex initiatives, such as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology[2] (Cobos
et al., 2016) and big data analytics (Fan and Gordon, 2014). That is, social media adoption
and use by hotels seems to require fewer resources, so that even midrange hotels have
become as active in the Twitter sphere as luxury and upscale hotels.

Also, the results associated with H7 seemed to indicate that the impact of hotels’ access
to resources was different for eWOM and customer engagement. The luxury, upscale and
economy categories of hotels were similar with respect to the level of eWOM. On the other
hand, only two groups (luxury, upscale) appeared to be similar, in terms of customer
engagement, and there was no significant difference between midrange and economy
categories. This may provide some evidence that engaging with customers is more resourceintensive than eWOM. In a SNS sphere, the latter mainly relies on the number of followers
(or friendships) and the popularity of hotel brand images and reputations (e.g. list counts). A
hotel may be able to increase its number of followers through attracting more users and
other strategies. On the other hand, this type of customer engagement would require
companies to invest more resources to generate original messages, respond to other users’
tweets and forward others’ messages of interest to a hotel’s followers.

The results associated with H? show that both eWOM and customer engagement are
positively associated with hotel RevPAR. This finding is similar to that of previous studies
showing that a high volume of online reviews and management responses on customer
review sites are favorably perceived by customers and may help increase a hotel’s financial
growth. Our findings indicate that hotels with high SNS use experience greater financial
success.

Theoretical implications
From a theoretical perspective, previous researchers have considered eWOM to be
important for measuring social media use (Hu et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015a; Ye et al., 2011)).
In our study, we explored both eWOM and customer engagement in understanding social
media use, which has become equally important in a SNS setting. Potential customers go to
online review sites to seek information and read both negative and positive reviews prior to
deciding where to make reservations. However, with Twitter, customers do not have to seek
out such information. For example, a customer’s negative tweet about a hotel’s service,
quality or safety automatically appears in hihe/sher followers’ feed and can be retweeted
instantly. The brevity of messages makes microblogging popular, and social networking
allows tweets or posts to spread quickly to a larger on-line community. Thus, timely,
appropriate responses from hotel management become even more important on SNSs than
on online review sites. Hotels’ marketers can influence customers’ perceptions and purchase
decisions via SNSs and Twitter and other similar SNSs can be effective tools for customer
relationship management, as well as act as conduits for sales and promotions. However, this
quick access can also turn on a hotel firm, in that it is increasingly possible that service
mistakes and improper responses could go viral on social media platforms (Krupnick, 2016).
In this context, hotels need to increase their ability to leverage SNSs for creating business
value, and this requires a strategic perspective on social media use (Hvass and Munar, 2012).
Previous studies show that the usage of SNSs is limited to one-way communication (e.g.
promotion) (Sevin, 2013). It is important for hotels’ management to understand the strategic
roles SNSs can play for a variety of business-to-customer activities, including promotion,
advertising, sales, customer service and stakeholder relationships, using two-way
communication and networking. To realize such strategic benefits, hotels need to put effort

into effectively bundling diverse resources (e.g. brand names, employee skills, customer
support processes, organization policies and technologies) (Trainor, 2012). For example,
hotels can take advantage of their offline brand images to increase their online presence.
Also, existing offline processes and policies, for example for customer service, can be
adapted to support customer inquiries on SNSs.

Practical implications

From a practical perspective, first, previous hospitality studies have shown the effects of
online review sites on hotel business and performance (Kwok et al, 2017). On SNSs, hotels
can be more proactive through networking (e.g. followers) and firm-generated content
(e.g. tweets) than simply by responding to customers’ online reviews. According to the
findings of this study, hotels’ access to resources is positively associated with Twitter use.
This study also showed, however, that even hotels (eg. midrange) with less access to
resources have been tapping into the potential of Twitter as a tool for marketing and
communication. Also, the study shows that Twitter use is positively associated with hotels’
RevPAR values. This means hotels need to think about SNSs as a strategic tool for
information diffusion and engagement and assemble organizational resources to build the
ability to leverage them.

Second, this study revealed that 87 per cent (113 out of 129) of the hotel parent companies
currently have Twitter accounts, with varying degrees of use. This suggests that social
media is already mainstream within the hotel business. However, as noted earlier, there has
been far less attention focused on many highly popular SNSs, as compared to online review
sites and user-generated content. This research has responded to that need by using
descriptive data extracted from Twitter-user profiles and firm-generated content (original
tweets, mentions and retweets by hotels) to measure the impact of Twitter use on RevPAR.
More research is clearly needed to better understand the role of emerging social media
platforms to increase success. Researchers can help hotel marketers effectively manage and
take advantage of these essential tools (e.g. Facebook, Instagram).

Third, previous studies of online reviews (e.g. TripAdvisor, Expedia) have collected data
through web crawling, as well as various techniques for analyzing text analytic techniques
for data preparation. Along these lines, this study has transformed the data using text
analytics methods (Chae, 2015) by collecting research data on social media use from actual
tweets and user profiles through Twitter API, rather than asking respondents (or hotel staff)
through a survey or in a case study setting for further statistical analysis. As services,
transactions and customer feedback are increasingly taking place online in the hotel
industry, understanding customer behavior in this unique setting is essential. In response,
research methods, such as big data analytics (Xiang et al. 2015) and computational research
(Lazer et al., 2009), are in demand, for collecting and analyzing social media and web data.
API-based data collection and advanced text analytical techniques such as topic modeling
(Blei, 2012) could provide valuable insights from big data regarding how hotels and
customers actually use social media. This type of big data research could help reveal the
extent to which social media is used by customers and hotel staff for billing questions,
service complaints, sales, advertising, customer service and other issues.

Limitations and future research

This study has limitations. First, for testing H7, the study used STR’s hotel scales and
classified the hotels into four groups for the level of organizational resources by the hotel
parent companies. The literature presents different types of resources (Grant, 1991), andthus, future research using the survey method could focus on the level of a specific resource
type (e.g. human resources, IT resources and market-based resources) as a measurement.

In terms of data collection, the researchers faced a lack of availability of RevPAR. One
of the authors manually searched hotels’ annual reports on the internet to collect
performance data, which yielded 25 samples for testing H2. Thus, the findings might not be
generalizable. Also, the unit of analysis was hotel parent companies. Future scholars could
consider a similar research model for individual hotels. In this endeavor, researchers could
consider organizational characteristics, hotel innovativeness and firm size (Michaelidou
et al, 2011) in their research design and utilize other statistical models with control
variables.

Previous studies of online review sites in hospitality research have focused primarily on
user-generated content (e.g. reviews, ratings) and considered the role of management
responses in their analysis. This study, on the other hand, has drawn the level of social
media use largely from hotel-generated contents. This approach does not capture whether or
how hotels have responded to negative/positive tweets from customers or from the general
public. Addressing this issue would require massive data collection and complex analytical
approaches: collecting all tweets mentioning hotel names, over a long period of time, and
further analyzing whether and how hotels respond to them, with advanced text analytic
techniques such as aspect sentiment analysis.

Finally, this study introduced measurement items (e.g. tweet counts) in the context of
Twitter use. It is acknowledged that different items of social media use (e.g. user influence)
are also discussed in websites (e.g. unionmetrics.com) and academic literature (Chae, 2015).
As future hospitality and tourism research further explores SNSs and firm-generated
content, it is important to consider these expanded measures in research design. Also, for
other emerging social media platforms, hospitality and tourism researchers would need to
develop/use new measurement items (Bonson and Ratkai, 2013) and advanced data analytic
techniques.
