beliefs", "  H5: Interest in YouTube makeup tutorials positively predicts social comparison, which in turn positively predicts postfeminist beliefs", " Because the Internet can complement, supplement, and reinforce offline political behaviors (Dahlgren, 2000; Kim et al_, 2017; Vitak et al_, 2011), we predict that those who engage civically offline will be comparatively likely to use the Internet for an array of political purposes:  H1: Offline civic engagement will be positively related to online political engagement", " Drawing on the notion that Internet-based political behaviors are linked to general patterns of social and political interaction (Kim et al_, 2017; Sajuria et al_, 2015; Vitak et al_, 2011), we hypothesize:  H2: Bridged social capital will be positively related to online political engagement", "  H3: Bonded social capital will be negatively related to online political engagement", " Thus,  H4: Ideological extremity will be positively related to online political engagement", " Subsequently, and in light of Facebook\u2019s near-total diffusion, digitally engaged citizens are increasingly likely to use of Facebook because the combined social and technical affordances of the platform conveniently and readily allow for political expression:  HS: Online political engagement will be positively related to political expression on Facebook", "  Hypothesis 1:

supposition below:  Hypothesis 3: Perceived reciprocity positively influences the intention to share information", "  Hypothesis 4: Social factors positively influence the intention to share information", " Hence, we postulate the following:  Hypothesis 5: Habit positively influences hashtags posting", " Thus, we crafted the hypothesis:  Hypothesis 6: Facilitating conditions positively influence hashtags posting", " The hypothesis that relates intention and behavior in this work is as follows:Kim et al_ II  Hypothesis 7: Intention to share information positively influences hashtags posting", "  Our first hypothesis was as follows:  H1_ There is a positive relationship between online self-disclosure and perceived interpersonal competence after controlling for the effect of frequency of online media use", " Therefore, our second hypothesis was as follows:  H2_ The relationship between online self-disclosure and perceived interpersonal competence is moderated by levels of shyness (e_g_, low, moderate, high) after controlling for the effect of frequency of online media use", " Therefore, our third hypothesis was as follows:  H3_ The relationship between self-disclosure and interpersonal competence is stronger for individuals reporting low levels of shyness than for individuals reporting moderate or high levels of shyness", " Based on this, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1a_ The research performance of world-class universities is positively related to their online video impact", " H1b_ The research performance of overall universities is positively related to their online video impact", " Therefore, we expect research performance to have a positive effect on the online video impact of universities and, thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:

exposed to dissimilar comments without supporting evidence will show greater levels of attitude polarization compared to people who are exposed to dissimilar comments with supporting evidence", " Thus, we propose:  H2a_ Participants who are exposed to uncivil dissimilar comments show lower levels of willingness to read more comments compared with people who are exposed to civil dissimilar comments", " As such:  H2b_ Participants who are exposed to dissimilar comments without supporting evidence will show lower levels of willingness to read more comments compared to people who are exposed to dissimilar comments with supporting evidence", " Similarly, the current study also predicts that exposure to uncivil disagreement comments will arouse negative emotion, as follows:  H3a_ : Participants who are exposed to uncivil dissimilar comments will show greater levels of negative emotion compared with people who are exposed to civil dissimilar comments", " The following is proposed:  H3b_ : Participants who are exposed to dissimilar comments without supporting evidence will show greater levels of negative emotion compared to people who are exposed to dissimilar comments with supporting evidence", " People are generally motivated to listen to other citizens' views and prefer their discussions to be civil in tone in everyday political talk (Conover & Searing, 2005), but if dissimilar comments are expressed uncivilly, the intention to read more comments will be decreased (see H2a), which can result in more polarized attitudes", " Given this evidence, I hypothesize the following:  H1: Young people will be more likely to express their political views in an anonymous (vs identifiable) social media environment", " To test this possibility, I predict the following:  H2: Young people will be more likely to express their political views in bounded (vs unbounded) social media environments", " Overall, this research suggests the following hypotheses:  H4: Young people who choose to express their political views will rate their expression as exerting more political voice and influence in bounded (vs unbounded) social media environments", "  H5: Young people will, in general, perceive bounded social media environments as better places to exert political voice and influence than unbounded social media environments", "  H1: The use of Message Tools in a

activities have a_ positive effect on perceived privacy control", "  H5; Perceived privacy control has a positive effect on self-disclosure of information", "  Given the above-mentioned findings, we have formulated the hypotheses concerning the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM as follows:  H1: There is a negative relationship between satisfaction and eWOM volume", " H2: There is a positive relationship between satisfaction and eWOM valence", " This is why we formulate the following hypothesis:  H1\u2019: Gender moderates the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM volume", " This led us to the following hypothesis:  H2\u2019: Intensity of Facebook usage moderates the relationship between satisfaction and eWOM volume", "  Based on the previous results in literature, our hypotheses regarding the relationships between commitment and eWOM are expressed as follows:  H3: There is a positive relationship between affective commitment and eWOM volume", " H4: There is a positive relationship between affective commitment and eWOM valence", " H5: There is no relationship between high sacrifice commitment and eWOM volume", " H6: There is no relationship between high

on attitude toward usage", "  H5_ Wearable comfort has a positive effect on attitude toward using of VR glasses", " This can derive from the use of specific apps (e_g_, games), but potentially also just from enjoyment of the use of the devices in general_ Since both constructs have been validated numerous times (for a review, see King and He, 2006), we refer to these studies and replicatively hypothesize:  H6_ Utilitarian benefits have a positive effect on attitude toward using of VR glasses", "  H7_ Hedonic benefits have a positive effect on attitude toward using of VR glasses", " Thus:

adolescents\u2019 alcohol abuse", " In line with these findings, we expect that sharing alcohol-related content on SNS may affect adolescents\u2019 attitudes, which in tur predict their engagement in alcohol abuse:  Hp: The relation between displaying alcohol-related content and alcohol abuse is mediated  by a more positive attitude towards alcohol use", " In line with this hypothesis we expect

participate in the supplementary Facebook group", " Thus, we hypothesize that a greater trait fear of isolation will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H1)_  The SoS theory noted, however, that some individuals will always be willing to express their opinion", " We expect that having stronger attitudes regarding police discrimination will be associated with less willingness to self-censor (H2)_  Another primary tenet of SoS is that individuals speak out based on their assessment of the opinion climate and whether their opinion aligns with the majority (Noelle-Neumann, 1974, 1993)", " Thus, we hypothesize that those who believe their opinion is congruent with the majority of their Facebook network will be less likely to self-censor (H6)_  The SoS also accounts for perceptions of future change in the opinion climate", " Thus, we expect that perceptions of future opinion congruency will be associated with opinion expression such that those who believe their opinion will align with the majority of their Facebook network in the future will be less likely to selfcensor (H7)_  Affordances of SNSs  It is important to examine SNSs as a specific context for the SoS", " Following these findings, we expect that higher levels of social presence will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H9)_  One of the most commonly studied affordances in CMC research is anonymity", " Thus, we expect that higher perceptions of persistence will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H11)_  METHOD  Sample and Procedure  Study methods were approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Review Board in February 2016, and data collection commenced May 2016_ U_S_ Facebook users were recruited via Qualtrics for participation in an online survey about news and attitudes", " Hence, we posit the following hypothesis:  H1_ Users are more likely to experience benign envy than malicious envy on social media", " As benign envy is often characterized by a more positive regard toward the envied person (Van de Ven et al_, 2009) and sharing experiential purchases usually creates a more positive impression than sharing material purchases, it is assumed that:  H2_ Experiential purchases are more likely to trigger benign envy than material purchases", " Therefore, we posit the following hypothesis:  H3_ Material purchases are more likely to trigger malicious envy than experiential purchases", " Therefore, we posit the following hypotheses: H4_ As benign envy increases, the purchase intention of the envied object increases", "  H5_ As malicious envy increases, the purchase intention of a superior object increases", " Based on the previous reasoning and findings, it is hypothesized that:  H6_ Posts addressing the monetary and material values (i_e_ material phrasing) of a purchase are more likely to be perceived with a higher intention of showing off than posts addressing the experiential values (i_e_ experiential phrasing)", "  H7_ Experiential phrasing triggers more benign envy than material phrasing (due to a lower level of perceived intention of showing off)", "  H8_ Material phrasing triggers more malicious envy than experiential phrasing (due to a higher level of perceived intention of showing off)", " As the entertainment features of a fan page can engage its users and encourage them to continue to stay on the fan page, we conjecture that the higher the level of the entertainment gratifications in a tourist attraction fan page will increase the level of engagement with a fan page user, which leads to their more frequent visits and use the fan page and generate a positive attitude toward the fan page concerned:  H1_ The level of the entertainment gratifications provided with a tourist attraction fan page has a positive impact on a user\u2019s attitude toward the page", " It is because the fan page is managed by the tourist attraction concerned and is supposed to provide helpful and reliable information to its fans:  H2_ The level of informativeness gratifications of a tourist attraction fan page has a positive impact on a user\u2019s attitude toward the page", " Therefore, we conjecture that the level of socializing gratifications occurred at a tourist attraction fan page has a positive impact on a user\u2019s attitude toward the page:  H3_ The level of socializing activities provided with a tourist attraction fan page has a positive impact on a user\u2019s attitude toward the page", " Further, a user\u2019s attitude toward a tourist attraction fan page will also have an impact on the intention to visit the attraction:  H4_ A user\u2019s attitude toward a tourist attraction fan page has a positive impact on his/her attitude toward the tourist attraction itself", "  H5_ A user\u2019s attitude toward a tourist attraction has a positive impact on his/her intention to visit the attraction", " Based on above predictions, we proposed the following hypothesis:  H1_ SNS fatigue is positively related to passive SNS use", "  H2b_ Impression management concern is positively related to SNS fatigue", "  H3b_ Privacy concern is positively related to SNS fatigue", " Thus the following four hypotheses are proposed:  H4a_ Sense of membership will moderate the relationship between impression management concern and passive SNS use such that the relationship is weaker when sense of membership is high", "  H4b_ Sense of membership will moderate the relationship between impression management concern and SNS fatigue such that the relationship is weaker when sense of membership is high", "H4c_ Sense of membership will moderate the relationship between privacy concern and passive SNS use such that the relationship is weaker when sense of membership is high", "  H4d_ Sense of membership will moderate the relationship between privacy concern and  SNS fatigue such that the relationship is weaker when sense of membership is high", "  Based on these theoretical premises, we infer that:  H2_ Condition similarity has a significant positive effect on context similarity", "  Starting from these considerations, we presume that:  H4_ Condition similarity has a significant positive influence on catalyst similarity", "  Building on this logic, we infer that:  H5_ Catalyst similarity has a significant positive influence on social network development", "\u201d  Based on these considerations, we infer that:  H6_ Condition similarity has a significant positive influence on consequence similarity", "  Building on the aforementioned research directions, we presume that:  H7_ Consequence similarity has a significant positive effect on social network development", "  Based on these considerations, we presume that:  H8_ Condition similarity has a significant positive influence on connection similarity", " Starting from these premises, we infer that:  H9_ Connection similarity has a significant positive influence on social network development", " One can speculate that SNS addiction may negatively impair the individual\u2019s performance in the workplace, leading to the hypothesis  H1_ Greater addiction to SNSs reduces performance", " This constant thinking about things that they want to do on SNSs makes it hard for them to pay attention to other tasks, leading to the hypothesis  H2_ Greater addiction to SNSs increases task distraction", " Accordingly, in this paper, it is posited that the divided attention resulting from SNS addiction can prevent users from thinking clearly about the tasks at hand, ultimately impairing performance and thus leading to the hypothesis  H4_ Greater task distraction reduces performance", " Therefore, it is posited that positive emotions will improve employee\u2019s health, leading to the hypothesis  H5_ Greater positive emotions improve health", " Average path coefficient (APC) 0_206 P < 0_01 H1: Greater addiction to SNSs reduces performance", " Yes Average block VIF (AVIF) 1_356 Acceptable if <5, ideally <3_3 H4: Greater task distraction reduces performance", " Yes (AFVIF) H6: Greater positive emotions improve health", " N = 805_ *p < _05, **p < _01, ***p < _001_  \u201cactual\u201d friends (H2,), the ratio of \u201cactual\u201d to total friends (H2,), and SMRMB (H>,) would be positively associated with perceived support", " Hence, our first hypothesis:  H1_ Socioeconomic constrains affect the use and political effectiveness of digital and social media by SMOs in a developing country like Colombia", " This results in our second hypothesis:  H2_ Fear of oppression by government and companies limits the engagement of SMO members in digital and social media", " We therefore hypothesise the following:  H3_ Social and digital media use by SMOs does not necessarily translate into greater power", "  Our fourth hypothesis is therefore as follows:  H4_ Internal \u2018politics of knowledge\u2019 prevent digital and social media to produce horizontal leadership structures within SMOs", "  Fear of oppression (H2)_ Also the fear that deficient information management may lead to a loss of legitimacy or repercussions affected how SMOs used the Internet", " Based on these arguments, the following hypotheses are proposed:  H1_ Socialness perceptions have a positive effect on pleasure during WeChat usage", "  H2_ Socialness perceptions have a positive effect on arousal during WeChat usage", "  H9_ Socialness perceptions have a positive effect on involvement during Wechat usage", "  H11_ Socialness perceptions have a positive effect on WOM during Wechat usage", " Therefore:  H3_ Involvement has a positive effect on pleasure during WeChat usage", "  H4__ : Involvement has a positive effect on arousal during WeChat usage", " This leads to the following hypotheses:  H5_ Media Richness has a positive effect on pleasure during WeChat usage", "  H6_ Media Richness has a positive effect on arousal during WeChat usage", "  H10_ Media Richness has a positive effect on involvement during WecChat usage", "  H12_ Media Richness has a positive effect on eWOM", " This leads to the following hypotheses:  H7_ Pleasure has a positive effect on positive WOM", " H8_ Arousal has a positive effect on positive WOM", "  H13_ Arousal has a positive effect on pleasure", " Therefore, we hypothesize:  Hypothesis 1a_ Source trustworthiness has a positive impact on individual retweeting behavior", "  Hypothesis 1b_ Source attractiveness has a positive impact on individual retweeting behavior", " Therefore, we hypothesize:  Hypothesis 2_ Information richness of the stimuli has a positive impact on individual retweeting behavior", " Based on social cognition theory and findings of prior studies, we hypothesize:  Hypothesis 3_ Topical relevance with the receiver has a positive impact on individual retweeting behavior", " Thus, we hypothesize:  Hypothesis 4_ Social tie strength between the source and the receiver has a positive impact on individual retweeting behavior", " Accordingly, we hypothesize:  Hypothesis 5_ Bandwagon effect has a positive impact on individual retweeting behavior", " Drawing on previous studies, it is assumed that selfdisclosure on Facebook could contribute to enacted social support on Facebook, which is associated with one's perceived social support in general_ Thus, the following hypotheses are proposed:  H3_ Self-disclosure on SNSs is positively related to enacted social support on SNSs", " Zhang / Computers in Human Behavior 75 (2017) 527\u2014537  H4_ Enacted social support on Facebook is positively related to perceived social support", "  H1_ Identification with an audience group is positively related to continuous watching intention", "  H2_ Identification with a broadcaster is positively related to continuous watching intention", "  H3_ Experience of parasocial interaction is positively related to broadcaster identification", " Hu et al_ / Computers in Human Behavior 75 (2017) 594\u2014606 597  H4_ Actual self-congruity is positively related to broadcaster identification", "  H5_ Ideal self-congruity is positively related to broadcaster identification", "  H7_ Cognitive communion is positively related to group  identification", "  H9b_ The influence of broadcaster identification on continuous watching intention will be stronger in talent shows streaming than in video games streaming", " Therefore, I hypothesized the following:  Hypothesis 1 (H1)_ Argument quality of ITAs could positively affect perceived ITA quality", " Hypothesis 2 (H2)_ Argument quality of ITAs could positively affect ITA fit-to-task", " Hypothesis 3 (H3)_ Argument quality of ITAs could positively affect trust in the ITA creator", " Hypothesis 4 (H4)_ Argument quality of ITAs could negatively affect perceived risk", " Therefore, I hypothesized the following:  Hypothesis 5 (H5)_ Peer tourist source of ITAs could positively affect perceived ITA quality", " Hypothesis 6 (H6)_ Peer tourist source of ITAs could positively affect ITA fit-to-task", " Hypothesis 7 (H7)_ Peer tourist source of ITAs could positively affect trust in the ITA creator", " Hypothesis 8 (H8)_ Peer tourist source of ITAs could negatively affect perceived risk", " Therefore, I hypothesized the following:  Hypothesis 9 (H9)_ Perceived ITA quality could positively affect the perceived usefulness of ITAs", " Hypothesis 11 (H11)_ Trusting belief in ITAs could positively affect the perceived usefulness of the ITA", " Hypothesis 12 (H12)_ Perceived risk could negatively affect the perceived usefulness of ITAs", "  Hypothesis 13 (H13)_ Perceived ITA quality could positively affect the perceived enjoyment of ITAs", " Hypothesis 14 (H14)_ Information fit-to-task of ITAs could positively affect the perceived enjoyment of ITAs", " Hypothesis 15 (H15)_ Trusting belief in ITAs could positively affect the perceived enjoyment of ITAs", " Hypothesis 16 (H16)_ Perceived risk could negatively affect the perceived enjoyment of ITAs", " Therefore, I hypothesize the following:  Hypothesis 17 (H17)_ Perceived usefulness could positively affect the satisfaction", " Hypothesis 18 (H18)_ Perceived enjoyment could positively affect the satisfaction", " Hypothesis 19 (H19)_ Satisfaction could positively affect the ITA adoption intention", " Hypothesis 20 (H20)_ Satisfaction could positively affect the planned visit intention", " Hypothesis 21 (H21)_ Satisfaction could positively affect the unplanned visit intention", " Hypothesis 22 (H22)_ Satisfaction could positively affect the word-of-mouth intention", " Therefore, extrapolating from Meier and Gray (2014)\u2019s and Fardouly and Vartanian (2015)'s findings on Facebook exposure to likely outcomes associated with Instagram, we predicted:  (H|h)1a_ Appearance-related social comparisons on Instagram will be positively related to body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness", " More specifically, we predict:  H2_ Individuals with higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness for mates will report engaging in more appearance-related social comparisons on Instagram than individuals with lower levels of intrasexual competitiveness for mates", " Applying this rationale to form a hypothesis, a positive association between social play dependency and SNS usage is predicted:  H1_ People's social play dependency on SNS will be positively associated with their frequency of SNS usage, for both English and Spanish SNS", " Thus, it is hypothesized that:  H2_ People's English SNS usage frequency will be positively correlated with their Spanish SNS usage frequency", " Based on this rationale, the third and fourth hypotheses are generated as follows:  H3_ More usage of English SNS will be positively associated with people's American cultural orientations", "  H4_ More usage of Spanish SNS will be positively associated with people's Hispanic cultural orientations", " Specifically, it is hypothesized that:  H5_ People's cultural orientations will influence their evaluations of two experimental websites that: a) when the website is related to American culture, people's American cultural orientations will be positively associated with their website evaluations; b) when the website is related to Hispanic culture, people's Hispanic cultural orientations will be positively associated with their website evaluations", "  H1_ There is a significant difference between the various attributes of Five Factor (NEO-PI-R) Model and the adoption of the Behavioral Trend \u201cGoing Private in Public\u201d of the Facebook users", " Therefore, it is hypothesized that:  H2_ There is a positive relationship between IQ and satisfaction", "  H3_ There is a positive relationship between IQ and Cl of following Facebook page", "  H4_ Satisfied users will follow government Facebook page", "  H5_ The direct relationship between IQ and CI of following Facebook page is mediated by satisfaction of government's Facebook  page", " Hence, we expect:  H1_ Media multitasking will lead to a lower state self-esteem when individuals use SNSs compared to when they read an informational article", " Summarized, and as illustrated in Fig_ 1, we formulate the following hypothesis:  H2_ Media multitasking with an SNS will lead to lower levels of perceived irritation towards advertising, compared to media multitasking with an online informational article, and this effect will be mediated by state self-esteem", "  H2a: The higher users\u2019 online trust, the more likely they are to experience serendipity", "  H3a: The higher users\u2019 level of online self-disclosure, the more likely they are to experience serendipity", "  H3b: The higher users\u2019 online trust, the higher their levels of online self-disclosure", "  H3c: The higher users\u2019 level of online self-disclosure, the higher their satisfaction with the online service", "  H4: The higher users\u2019 serendipity experiences, the more satisfied they are with an online service", "  H1: Self-Efficacy: As to the impact of self-efficacy on serendipity, we propose that this effect will be especially pronounced in the case of information services and SNS", "  H3: Self-Disclosure: We propose that the impact of selfdisclosure should be especially pronounced in the case of SNS", "  H4: Satisfaction: We expect serendipity to exert the strongest positive effect on user satisfaction in the context of SNS", " Therefore, we propose that the following:  HS: Satisfaction with an Instagram account has a positive effect on user intention to interact with that Instagram account", " Therefore, we hypothesize as follows:  H1 The average age of TMT members has a positive impact on franchising", " Given the literature review and the risk-averse nature of franchising, a third hypothesis is presented as follows:  H3 The average formal education level of TMT members has a negative impact on franchising", " This research thus proposes the following hypothesis:  H4 TMT members\u2019 value of share ownership has a positive impact on franchising", "  Hypothesis 1: Individuals who use SNS will have higher support for democratic governance than people who do not use SNS", "  Hypothesis 2: Individuals who seek news on SNS will have higher support for democratic governance than people who do not use SNS", "  H1: The perceived importance of the functions of Facebook (Internal Core Functions) influences its members\u2019  usage intensity", " Accordingly, we propose External Service Quality, measuring the perceived quality of the external services provided by Facebook, as a further determinant of Facebook members\u2019 usage intensity in Hypothesis 2_  Hz: The perceived quality of Facebook\u2019s external service provision (External Service Quality) influences its  members\u2019 usage intensity", "  H3: The perceived need for data security and privacy (Need for Data Privacy) influences Facebook members\u2019  usage intensity", "  Hz: The perceived possibility to find new friends on Facebook (Need for New Friends) influences its members\u2019  usage intensity", "  Hs: The perceived possibility to present oneself on Facebook (Need for Social Self-Portrayal) influences its  members\u2019 usage intensity", "  He: Facebook members\u2019 Usage Intensity is positively related to their Approval of Personalized Facebook Ads", "  H7: Facebook members\u2019 Usage Intensity is positively related to their Word-of-Mouth Intention regarding the  advertised products or services", " Based on these goals, the following hypotheses were developed:  Hypothesis 1: Replicating previous research, participants who are allowed to have their cell phones (regardless of the cell phone policy) will become more distracted and thus perform worse on the multiple-choice test than those students who do not have access to their phones", "  Hypothesis 2: Participants who are not permitted to use their phone (whether they are permitted to keep it or have it removed) will become more distracted and thus will perform worse on the multiple-choice test than those students who are permitted to use their cell phone without any restrictions", "  Hypothesis 4: Individual differences in emotion-regulation style will moderate the impact of cell phone policy condition on multiple-choice test performance", " Specifically, the size of the individual differences effect hypothesized earlier (Hypothesis 3) will be larger in cell phone policy conditions when participants are not allowed to use their cell phone compared with the conditions when participants are allowed to use their cell phone", " Thus, the following hypothesis is advanced:  H1_ Individuals with higher self-monitoring will prefer Instagram to Pinterest, while low self-monitors will prefer Pinterest to Instagram", " Thus, the following hypotheses are advanced:  H2a_ After being primed by Instagram, users will exhibit higher self-monitoring than their dispositional self-monitoring", "  H2b_ After being primed by Pinterest, users will show lower selfmonitoring than their dispositional self-monitoring", "  H3a_ Individuals who use Pinterest will display a more positive attitude toward a brand and ad when the brand is advertised with a product-oriented rather than image-oriented advertisement", "  H3b_ Individuals who use Instagram will display a more positive attitude toward a brand and ad when the brand is advertised with an image-oriented rather than product-oriented advertisement", " Therefore, our first hypothesis is as follows:  H1: Differences exist between men and women regarding the relevance of specific gratifications of fitness app usage", " Therefore, we predict the following more specific hypothesis:  H2: Gratifications that are connected with a comparison of results are more relevant for men than for women", " Based on the gender differences in gratifications in general fitness app usage, we also assume that the usage and gratifications for specific functions of mHealth applications (e_g_, voice coach or sharing results) are gender-specific and we propose the final hypothesis:  H3: Differences exist between men and women regarding the usage of specific mHealth functions", " We thus hypothesised that:  H1_ Online troublemakers will be more prominent in larger online networks", " On the basis of the above findings we predicted that:  H2_ Egos reporting incidents of online trouble will likely be female and younger in age", "  H3_ Alters exhibiting troublesome behaviour will likely be male and younger in age", " We therefore predicted that:  H4_ Online popularity will be positively associated with instances of negative online behaviour", " It was therefore expected that:  H5_ Offline interactions will moderate the relationship between Facebook interactions and instances of online disagreement", " We therefore, hypothesis that:  H6_ Increased instances of online disagreement will be attributed to significant known contacts", " As a consequence of the above, we suggest the following hypotheses:  H1: Social image impacts positively on the perceived usefulness of F-commerce platforms", "  H2: Social image impacts positively on users\u2019 intention to use F-commerce platforms", " Consequently, we propose the following research hypotheses:  H3: Subjective norms impact positively on users\u2019 intention to use F-commerce platforms", "  H4: Subjective norms impact positively on perceived usefulness for users of F-commerce platforms", "  H5: Subjective norms have a positive influence on social image for users of F-commerce platforms", " Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H6: Perceived usefulness impacts positively on intention to use for users of F-commerce platforms  3_4_ Effects of trust  In the last few decades, research carried out in the area of marketing has highlighted the importance of trust between the parts as an element that favors the continuity of the relationship, making it an aspect of great importance in the area of business (Morgan and Hunt, 1994)", "  Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:  H7: Trust impacts positively on perceived usefulness for users of F-commerce platforms", " Alonso-Dos-Santos/Journal of Engineering and Technology Management 44 (2017) 1-18 5 H8: Trust impacts positively on users\u2019 intention to use of F-commerce platforms", " For this reason, we propose the following hypothesis:  H9: E-word-of-mouth impacts positively on the intention to use F-commerce platforms", " We therefore propose the following research hypothesis:  H10: The user\u2019s perceived value of F-commerce platforms has a positive relationship with intention to use", " In light of all these findings, this research proposes the following hypothesis:  H11: age has a mediating effect in the intention to use of F-commerce platforms", " Thus, we hypothesize:  H1-1_ Direct network externalities positively influence social interaction ties", " Therefore, we hypothesize:  H1-2_ Indirect network externalities positively influence social interaction ties", " Therefore, we propose that:  H2-1_ Direct network externalities positively influence social value", " Therefore, we hypothesize that:  H2-2_ Direct network externalities positively influence information value", " Therefore, we hypothesize that:  H2-3_ Direct network externalities positively influence emotional value", " Therefore, we propose that:  H2-4_ Direct network externalities positively influence hedonic value", " We propose that:  H3-2_ Indirect network externalities positively influence  information value", " Therefore, we propose that:  H4-1_ Social interaction ties positively influence social value", " Therefore, we posit that:  H4-2_ Social interaction ties positively influence information value", " We infer that:  H4-3_ Social interaction ties positively influence emotional value", " Therefore, we hypothesize that:  H4-4_ Social interaction ties positively influence hedonic value", " We posit that:  H5-1_ Social value positively influences continuance intention", "  H5-2_ Information value positively influences continuance intention", " H5-3_ Emotional value _ positively influences continuance intention", "  H5-4_ Hedonic value positively influences continuance intention", "  Accordingly, we proposed the following hypotheses based on the previous references:  H1: There will be a correlation between online data including SNS and the viewing rate data measured in AMR and SHR for media content", "  H1-1: There will be a correlation between CGM data and the viewing rate data measured in AMR for media content", "  H1-2: There will be a correlation between CGM data and the viewing rate data measured in SHR for media content", "  H1-3: There will be a correlation between Media data and the viewing rate data measured in AMR for media content", "  H1-4: There will be a correlation between Media data  and the viewing rate data measured in SHR for media content", "  H2: Online data (big data) will project the viewing rate of media content measured in AMR and SHR_  H2-1:  CGM data will project the viewing rate of media content measured in AMR", " We proposed the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 1 (H1)_ The greater the level of SE, the higher the LA will be", " Hypothesis 2 (H2)_ The greater the AS, the higher the LA will be", "  Hypothesis 3 (H3)_ The influence of SE on LA will be moderated by OSN attention, such that the effect will be stronger for HOASs", "  Hypothesis 4 (H4)_ The influence of AS on LA will be moderated by OSN attention, such that the effect will be stronger for HOASs", "  H1: The total number of likes received by a company on Facebook will be positively associated with its reputation", "  H2: The total number of shares received by a company on Facebook will be positively associated with its reputation", "  H3: The total number of positive comments received by a company on Facebook will be positively associated with its reputation", "  H4: The total number of negative comments received by a company on Facebook will be negatively associated with its reputation", " Based on the literature reviewed above, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1_ Instagram usage has a negative influence on body satisfaction", " The current study proposes the following hypotheses:  H2_ Self-schema has a positive influence on self-discrepancy", "  H3_ Self-schema and self-discrepancy sequentially mediate the negative influence of Instagram photo usage on body satisfaction", " Based on the assumption, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H4_ Self-esteem moderates the influence of Instagram usage on self-schema", " To test this, the following hypothesis is developed:  H5_ Self-esteem moderates the negative influence of Instagram photo exposure on body satisfaction which is mediated by appearance self-schema and appearance self-discrepancy", " Therefore, we construct the following hypotheses:  (H|h)1a _ Incorporating topic-based features into the original feature set improves the accuracy of classifiers", "  H1b_ Incorporating topic-based features into the original feature set improves the precision of classifiers", " Hence, we hypothesize:  H2a_ Incorporating user-based features into the original feature set improves the accuracy of classifiers", "  H2b_ Incorporating user-based features into the original feature set improves the precision of classifiers", " Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1_ Experience in the use of Facebook has a positive influence on the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " In view of these considerations, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H2_ Activity in Facebook positively influences the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " Taking into account the above postulates, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H3_ The size of the Facebook online community positively influences the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H4_ The size of the local population is positively associated with the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " Reflecting these findings, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H5_ The economic capacity of a local population is positively associated with the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H6_ Political competition is positively associated with the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H7_ The fact that a municipality is governed by a left-wing political party is positively associated with the use of dialogic principles in local governments\u2019 Facebook profiles", " Thus, this study proposes the fifth hypothesis as follows:  H,: On social networking sites, CCI has a positive effect on satisfaction", " Thus, this study proposes the sixth hypothesis as follows:  H,: On social networking sites, CCI has a positive effect on commitment", " Thus, this study proposes the fourth hypothesis as follows:  H;: On social networking sites, satisfaction has a positive effect on commitment", " Thus, this study proposes three hypotheses, as follows: H,: On social networking sites, commitment has a positive effect on loyalty", "  H;: On social networking sites, commitment has a positive effect on cooperation", " Consequently, we propose the following hypotheses:  (H1) Perceived ease of use (PEU) positively influences user's perceived usefulness (PU) of playing mobile social games", "  (H2) Perceived ease of use (PEU) positively influences user's attitude (ATT) on social based mobile games", "  (H3) Perceived usefulness (PU) positively influences user\u2019s attitude (ATT) on mobile social gaming", "  (H4) Perceived usefulness (PU) positively influences user's intention (BI) to play mobile social games", "  (H5) Attitude (ATT) positively influences user\u2019s intention (BI) to play mobile social games", " Since social network based mobile gaming is also a kind of hedonic systems, we made the following hypotheses:  (H6) Perceived enjoyment (PE) positively influences attitude (ATT) on mobile social gaming", "  (H7) Perceived enjoyment (PE) positively influences intention (FL) to play mobile social games", "  (H8) Perceived enjoyment (PE) positively perceived usefulness (PU) of playing mobile social gaming", " Hence, two hypotheses are posited as follows:  (H9) Use context (UC) positively influences perceived enjoyment (PE) of mobile social gaming", "  (H10) Use context (UC) positively influences perceived ease of use (PEU) to play mobile social games", " Consequently, we have the following hypothesis:  (H11) Flow (FL) positively influences intention (BI) to play mobile social gaming", " Those above really bring much fun and therefore we propose the following hypotheses:  (H12) Social interaction (SI) positively influences perceived enjoyment (PE) of mobile social gaming", "  (H13) Social interaction (SI) positively influences use context (UC) of mobile social gaming", " Hence, our hypothesis on altruism is stated as follows:  (H14) Altruism (ALT) positively influences social interaction (SI) of mobile social gaming", "  H2: Online firestorms are covered more often by journalists writing for online than for print media", " This leads us to the following hypothesis:  H3: When the firestorm object is quoted, its overall portrayal is more positive than when it is not quoted", " The second hypothesis is proposed accordingly:  H2_ Seeking interaction with a company on its Facebook page has a positive effect on company reputation", " The third hypothesis is thus proposed:  H3_ Expressing self-concept on a company\u2019s Facebook page has a positive effect on company tribalism", " The fourth hypothesis is proposed accordingly:  H4_ Seeking interaction with others on a company\u2019s Facebook page has a positive effect on company tribalism", " Based on this understanding, the fifth and sixth hypotheses were proposed:  H5_ Company reputation has a positive effect on trust in the company", " H6_ Company reputation has a positive effect on satisfaction with the company", " Based on these prior research findings, the seventh and eighth hypotheses were proposed:  H7_ Company tribalism has a positive effect on trust in the company", " H8_ Company tribalism has a positive effect on satisfaction with the company", " Accordingly, the ninth and tenth hypotheses were proposed:  H9_ Seeking entertainment has a positive effect on trust in the company", " H10_ Seeking entertainment has a positive effect on satisfaction with the company", " Accordingly, the next two hypotheses were

differences in direct and indirect measures of support for the JWST project, we also hypothesized that participants would prefer the interactive media for their quality, engagement, and level of

NASA-produced texts would increase support for a specific project, we further hypothesized that this increase would translate into greater support for the agency as a whole:  Hypothesis 3: NASA texts supporting JWST will increase general support for NASA projects and funding, and the interactive media will result in greater increases of support for NASA than the traditional texts", " Further, it

positively related to Facebook addiction", "  H3_ Higher Facebook intensity is positively related to Facebook addiction", "  H4_ Facebook addiction is negatively related to life satisfaction", "  Therefore, our first hypothesis is:  H1_ When engaging in online self-presentations on Facebook, people will use enhancement strategies more than derogation strategies", "  Therefore, our second hypothesis is as follows:  H2_ Individuals with performance achievement goals will adopt enhancement motivation for online self-presentation, while individuals driven by mastery achievement goals will

information for small monetary rewards in some online environments (Acquisti, 2004b; Beresford et al, 2011; Grossklags and Acquisti, 2007; Jentzsch et al, 2012), we would expect that the sum offered in exchange for disclosing users\u2019 offline identities will be the main factor in their decision to accept such trade offers:  H1_ The sum of money offered to virtual world users in exchange for

interaction, thus, being an enabler for sociable individuals, the following hypothesis is posed:  H1_ Sociability (SOCIAL) will serve as a significant discriminating factor in the prediction of group membership across Facebook users and non-users (in that, Facebook users will score significantly higher on this factor than non-users)", " Given the strong relationship between shyness and Internet

messages on Facebook", "  Hypothesis 2B: A negative association between self-presentational concerns and expression of negative emotions is greater in status updates than in wall posts or private messages on Facebook", "\u2019 Therefore, we predict the following:  Hypothesis 3: Verbal immediacy is higher in private messages compared with public wall posts on Facebook", "  Hypothesis 4: A positive association between partner familiarity and verbal immediacy is greater in public wall posts than in private messages on Facebook", "  Hypothesis 1a_ There will be a significant positive relationship between the disposition for online self-disclosure at T1 and the frequency of SNS use at T2 (selection effect)", "  At the same time, the use of SNSs reinforces self-disclosure through social capital: Previous research illustrates that online self-disclosure is positively related to online social capital_  Hypothesis 1b_ There will be a significant positive relationship between the frequency of SNS use at T1 and the disposition for online self-disclosure at T2 (socialization effect)", " We thus propose that:  Hypothesis 2a_ The relationship between the disposition for online self-disclosure at T1 and the frequency of SNS use at T2 (selection effect) will be moderated by cumulative social capital (T2 \u2014 T1)", "  Hypothesis 2b_ The relationship between the frequency of SNS use at T1 and the disposition for online self-disclosure at T2 (socialization effect) will be moderated by cumulative social capital (T2 \u2014 T1)", " Hence, we offer these competing hypotheses:  (H|h)1a: Exposure to one\u2019s own Facebook profile self-presentation improves performance on a subsequent cognitive task", "  H1b: Exposure to one\u2019s own Facebook profile self-presentation hurts performance on a subsequent cognitive task", "  Because of their substantial advantages, we use implicit measures of self-esteem in our analysis, and advance the following hypothesis:  H2: Exposure to one\u2019s own Facebook profile self-presentation raises implicit self-esteem", " Our first hypothesis is thus:  Hypothesis 1: Fundraising expenses will be positively related to social media adoption and use", " To a large extent, the emphasis on a particular strategy is embodied in the amount of resources  allocated toward that strategy; accordingly, our second hypothesis is,Modeling the Adoption

we hypothesize such organizations have a greater incentive to reach out to both current and existing customers through social media:  Hypothesis 3: Program Service revenues will be positively related to social media adoption and use", " We thus make the following hypothesis:Modeling the Adoption and Use of Social Media 8  Hypothesis 4: Organizational size in assets will be positively related to social media adoption and use", "  In line with the above arguments, we hypothesize that organizations with a more established and far-reaching Web presence, as measured by the age of and number of visitors to their Website, should be more likely to adopt and use social media:  Hypothesis 5; Website age will be positively related to social media adoption and use", "  Hypothesis 6: Website reach will be positively related to social media adoption and use", " Given this bottom-up structure and less intense need to reach a broad spectrum of external publics, we posit top-down, organizational-driven communication on social media will not be as prevalent:  Hypothesis 7: Membership-based nonprofit organizations will be less likely to adopt and use social media", " Consequently, though larger boards are not always better, we hypothesize a positive association between board size and social media utilization:  Hypothesis 8: Organizations with larger boards will be more likely to adopt and use social media", " This leads to the following hypothesis:  Hypothesis 9: More efficient nonprofits will be more likely to adopt and use social media", " We hypothesize that, the higher theModeling the Adoption and Use of Social Media 11  level of dependence on these external stakeholders, the greater the level of online attention will be afforded them, and by extension, the greater the likelihood the organization will employ social media in its stakeholder relations efforts:  Hypothesis 10: Donor dependence will be positively related to an

associated with general self-disclosure, emotional disclosure, attentionseeking, and expression of hidden and ideal self-aspects", " Such an assumption forms the basis of our first hypothesis:  H1: If the volume of content transmission increases on microblogging networks, the network potential for produsage will increase at the expense of strict production and consumption", " Such a presumption leads us to the second  hypothesis:  H2: If users are given the opportunity to engage with content in social media, the network potential for produsage will be production-biased for hard news and consumption-biased for soft news content", "  Given the empirical support for Kreps\u2019 (1988) RHCCM and other theories/studies regarding the interrelationships between motives, communication competence, social support, and depression discussed in the above sections, the researchers proposed the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 1: Increased interpersonal motives for using Facebook will be associated with greater communication competence (faceto-face and CMC)", "  Hypothesis 2: Increases in social integrative motives for using Facebook will be associated with increases in Facebook social support satisfaction", "  Hypothesis 3: Increases in face-to-face communication competence will be associated with increases in face-to-face social support satisfaction", "  Hypothesis 4: Increases in CMC competence will be associated with increases in social support satisfaction", "  Hypothesis 5: Increases in face-to-face social support network satisfaction will be associated with

moderate the relationship between habit and usage continuance intention, such that with high privacy restrictiveness, habit will have a larger positive influence on usage continuance intention than with low privacy restrictiveness", "  H8: Site experience will moderate the relationship between habit and usage continuance intention, such that with high site experience, habit will have a larger positive influence on usage continuance intention than with low site experience", " Thus, we develop the following hypothesis:  Hypothesis 1: Online public self-consciousness is positively related to
