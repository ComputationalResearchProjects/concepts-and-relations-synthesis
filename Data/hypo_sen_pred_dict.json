ABSTRACT        Keywords: Multi-sided platform MNEs Internalization theory  The rise of the digital economy provides firms across the globe with unique business opportunities", " However\u2014with very few exceptions (Brouthers et al_, 2016; Chen, et al_, 2019; Holm, Decreton, Nell, & Klopf, 2017; Zeng & Glaister, 2016)\u2014there is a limited understanding behind the application of internalization theory and network theory to \u2018new\u2019 firms that are different from conventional MNEs (Buckley, 2016; Narula, 2012),", " In a similar vein, many scholars have highlighted the importance of subsidiaries developing their own competency-creating capabilities, which, in turn, demands that they become more embedded in external networks in their own localities (Andersson, Forsgren, & Holm, 2002; Andersson, Dellestrand, & Pedersen, 2014; Birkinshaw, Hood, & Jonsson, 1998; Fan, Cui, Li, & Zhu, 2015)", " How people interact, communicate, buy and sell items online with

effect may not equally influence all users\u2019 behavior (Knijnenburg & Kobsa, 2014; Lai & Hui, 2006), suggesting that individual differences or contextual factors should be incorporated into a research model to gain a more complete understanding", " As a result, users are likely to construct their preferences using various decisional shortcuts and contextual factors, such as privacy defaults, especially when they have unclear preferences or are not motivated to engage in effortful deliberation (Huh, Vosgerau, & Morewedge, 2014)", " Hence, we predict that the following baseline hypothesis:  H1_ Privacy defaults will have an impact on privacy preferences such that people are likely to preserve the default or choose alternative options proximal to the defaults", " Hence, we predict that:  H2_ Regulatory focus will have an impact on users' privacy preferences", "  Taken together, we predict that default effects (as predicted in H1) can be potentially moderated by regulatory focus such that default effects will be intensified for those with a strong prevention focus, because they are oriented towards stability, and reduced for promotionfocused individuals, who favor actions and change (Pham & Higgins, 2005)", "  H3_ The effect of default settings on preferences will be moderated by regulatory focus such that the default effect will be stronger for users with a strong prevention focus than for users with a strong promotion focus", "  2_3_2_ Attitudes, perceived efforts, and confidence  While H1-H3 focus on the effect of default settings and regulatory focus on behavioral outcomes, we also explore their effects on attitudinal and judgmental factors that are central to decision-making: attitudes towards the use of privacy settings, perceived effort in decisionmaking, and confidence", " Hence, we predict that:  H4_ a-c: Promotion focus will have a positive impact on (a) attitudes towards privacy setting use, (b) perceived effort, and (c) confidence when using privacy settings", " Taken together, we predict that a prevention focus will produce a relatively weaker positive (or negative) impact on user experiences:  H5_ a-c: A strong prevention focus will have a negative impact on (a) attitudes towards privacy setting use, (b) perceived effort, and (c) confidence when using privacy settings", "  3_ Study 1  In Study 1, we examined a baseline hypothesis (H1): the default effect on privacy preferences", "  3_2_ Results  We tested the default effect on privacy decision-making (H1) using ordinal regression analyses, because the dependent variable was an ordinal-level, multi-categorical variable", "  The results of ordinal regression analyses confirmed the significant default effects on users\u2019 choices (H1)_ Table 1 summarizes the results", " Hence, H1 was supported", "  5_ Results 5_1_ Behavioral impact (H1-H3)  H1 and H2 predicted the main effects of default setting and regulatory focus on users\u2019 preferences, respectively, and H3 predicted an interaction effect between default setting and regulatory focus", " Hence, H1 was supported", " Hence, the results partially supported H2_ Finally, the interaction effect between default and regulatory focus was not significant across the board", " Therefore, H3 was not supported", "  5_1_1_ Impacts on attitudes and judgments (H4-H5)  We ran ordinary least square (OLS) regression analyses predicting the effect of promotion focus (H4) and prevention focus (H5) on three attitudinal or judgmental outcomes: (a) attitudes; (b) perceived effort; and (c) confidence", " Hence, H4a, H4b, and H4c were all fully supported", " Hence, H5 was partially supported", "  In summary, in study 2, the default effect on users' preferences was replicated (H1)_ Regulatory focus also has a significant impact on a behavioral choice item (H2), and both a significant main effect and significant interaction effects on attitudes and judgmental outcomes (H3 & H4)_ The findings suggest that default effects are robust", " Specifically, in study 1, the results support H1, which predicts a significant default effect on users' privacy decision-making", "  With regards to H3, we did not find support for the moderating effect of regulatory focus on the association between defaults and preference", " Likewise, manipulation checks are omitted in most studies about default effects (e_g_, Johnson et al_, 2002; Lai & Hui, 2006) and reference points and omission bias (e_g_, Baron & Ritov, 1994)", " Beyond pleasure and pain: How motivation works", "27_  Huh,

to extract we avoided the standard Eigenvalue > 1 rule as it could offer inaccurate results (Glorfeld, 1995) and opted to use two different techniques in order to establish how many factors to

Hill, 2010)", " Empirical support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that shy individuals have been found to prefer online communication over FtF (e_g_, Bruss & Hill, 2010)", "  Our first hypothesis was as follows:  H1_ There is a positive relationship between online self-disclosure and perceived interpersonal competence after controlling for the effect of frequency of online media use", " Therefore, our second hypothesis was as follows:  H2_ The relationship between online self-disclosure and perceived interpersonal competence is moderated by levels of shyness (e_g_, low,

and Veletsianos, 2018), the use of YouTube by universities is gaining increasing importance, and so is the research on this field", " In this vein, the research performance \u2014as a key dimension of university prestige\u2014 can be related to the online video impact of the university, as the reputation of the content creator plays an important role in social media (Dijkmans et al_, 2015; Hsu et al_, 2013)", " Based on this, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1a_ The research performance of world-class universities is positively related to their online video impact", " H1b_ The research performance of overall universities is positively related to their online video impact", "  Additional to the connection between university prestige and impact in social media (Brech et al_, 2017), it has been argued that the reputation of the content creator can have a positive effect on user engagement and, for this reason, is key to social media (Dijkmans et al_, 2015; Hsu et al_, 2013)", " Therefore, we expect research performance to have a positive effect on the online video impact of universities and, thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H2a_ The research performance of world-class universities positively affects their online video impact", " H2b_ The research performance of overall universities positively affects their online video impact", " Based on this, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H3a_ The online video orientation of world-class universities positively affects their online video impact", " H3b_ The online video orientation of overall universities positively affects their online video impact", " Based on these arguments, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H4a_ The online video orientation of world-class universities moderates their relation between research performance and online video impact", "  H4b_ The online video orientation of overall universities moderates their relation between research performance and online video impact", "  Fig_ 1 depicts the relations posed in hypotheses H2 to H4: 3_ Methodology  3_1_ Measures  As shown in Table 1, the online video impact (ovi) construct is measured through Hj909,

of online video orientation on the relation between research performance and online video impact is studied to test hypothesis 4_ Hypotheses are first tested with the sample of world-class universities and then with the sample of overall universities in order to analyse the sub-hypotheses", " Finally, average Hj 900 is 10_4, the average number of videos uploaded per account is 592,7 and the average account oldness is 9 years", "  Regarding world-class universities (see Table 3), online video impact shows a positive and significant correlation with the all the metrics of research performance provided by different global rankings (ARWU, THE and Webometrics), meaning that the higher research performance of a university the higher its Hjo999_ Therefore, we accept our H1a_  In the case of overall universities (see Table 4), we draw on the U-Multirank, which, as previously explained, is a global ranking that covers a large number of universities and countries", " Therefore, we

only Google has a significant effect on selective exposure and in the expected direction\u2014 that is, it reduces the probability of selective exposure (H3)_ Neither Facebook nor other referrals have a significant effect on selective exposure compared to direct navigation", " Hence, when we assume heterogeneous slope effects, we find a positive effect of direct navigation on selective exposure\u2014albeit not a strong one\u2014and some support for H1_  The fifth and sixth models show the cross-level interactions", " As we can see from the coefficients and standard errors in Model 6, political interest is not a relevant moderator in the relationship between origins and selective exposure, lending no support to H2_1 and H3_1_ However, as Models 2 to 6 show, it has a strong direct effect in selective exposure, increasing the probability of selectivity by 14 percent, at most", " In particular, as expected (H2_2), among left-wing individuals, Facebook referred-news

as Facebook and Google (H2_1 and H3_1) compared to direct navigation, and that having a leftist ideology will increase selective exposure on Facebook compared to other forms of accessing news (H2_2)", " Although we did not find support for H1 when we assumed homogenous slope effects, when we allowed the effects of origins (the slope) to vary across individuals, we found that direct navigation

section has increasingly become important part of online space for individuals to share their thoughts and form their attitude (Graf, Erba, & Harn, 2017)", " A social media environment, such as comment sections, provides people with opportunities to share their thoughts and discuss them with others, increasing the chances of being exposed to diverse or dissimilar viewpoints (Kim, Hsu, & Gil de Zuniga, 2013)", " In fact, scholars have found the effects of uncivil discussion on people's perceptual polarization (Hwang, Kim, & Huh, 2014), weaker message satisfaction (Gervais, 2015), and closedmindedness (Hwang, Kim, & Kim, 2018)", " Thus, this study proposes the following hypothesis:  Hla_ Participants who are exposed to uncivil dissimilar comments, compared with people who are exposed to civil dissimilar comments, will show greater levels of attitude polarization", " The following is posited:  H1b_ Participants who are exposed to dissimilar comments without supporting evidence will show greater levels of attitude polarization compared to people who are exposed to dissimilar comments with supporting evidence", " Thus, we propose:  H2a_ Participants who are exposed to uncivil dissimilar comments show lower levels of willingness to read more comments compared with people who are exposed to civil dissimilar comments", " As such:  H2b_ Participants who are exposed to dissimilar comments without supporting evidence will show lower levels of willingness to read more comments compared to people who are exposed to dissimilar comments with supporting evidence", " Similarly, the current study also predicts that exposure to uncivil disagreement comments will arouse negative emotion, as follows:  H3a_ : Participants who are exposed to uncivil dissimilar comments will show greater levels of negative emotion compared with people who are exposed to civil dissimilar comments", " The following is proposed:  H3b_ : Participants who are exposed to dissimilar comments without supporting evidence will show greater levels of negative emotion compared to people who are exposed to dissimilar comments with supporting evidence", " People are generally motivated to listen to other citizens' views and prefer their discussions to be civil in tone in everyday political talk (Conover & Searing, 2005), but if dissimilar comments are expressed uncivilly, the intention to read more comments will be decreased (see H2a), which can result in more polarized attitudes", " Meanwhile, dissimilar comments without any supporting evidence may cause negative emotion (see H3b) and strengthen the original issue position rather than moderate attitude because there is no valid evidence to change their opinion", " To measure attitude polarization about the gun control issue, participants were asked to indicate on a 7-point scale the extent to which they agree or disagree with four items on gun control legislation: \u201cHow strongly do you support or oppose gun control", " (1 = very unfavorable to 7 = very strongly favorable),\u201d \u201cHow strongly do you agree or disagree with the necessity for gun control law", " An independent sample t-test confirmed a

tests  To examine how the civility and incivility of Facebook comments affect the participants' attitude polarization (Hla), an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed", " Therefore, Hla was

and higher proportions of active SM friends result in lower levels of social isolation and loneliness", "  Prior research has shown that helping,  selfexpression, and enjoyment are precursors of social capital on SM (e_g_ Kim, Kim, and Han 2011; Kim, Lee, and Bonn 2016; Tsai et al_ 2011)", " Seniors\u2019 purposes for using SM are to share information, maintain social networks, and express their ideas, feelings, and personalities (Kim, Kim, and Han 2011)", " SM sites have been developed into one of the main information sources for users and enable users to exchange information and experiences, thus building social capital (Chung, Han, and Koo 2015; Lee 2017)", " From the tourism perspectives, studies of SM on various topics have been well documented (e_g_ Hays, Page, and Buhalis 2013; Leung et al_ 2013; Munar and Jacobsen 2014; Zeng and Gerritsen 2014)", " Also, SM is gaining prominence as an element of destination marketing strategy, offering organisations with limited resources as a tool to reach a global audience (Hays, Page, and Buhalis 2013)", " In the context of SM used for tourism purposes, seniors\u2019 altruism has positive effects on their common bond and common identity attachments (Kim, Lee, and Bonn 2016), implying that helping behaviour influences bonding and bridging social capital_ Based on the literature cited above, we propose the following hypotheses:  Hj: Seniors\u2019 helping others has a positive effect on building bonding social capital for seniors using SM for tourism-related purposes", "  H,: Seniors\u2019 helping others has a positive effect on building bridging social capital for seniors using SM for tourism-related purposes", " As a tool of self-expression and a means of sharing information, online social networks help prevent older adults from feeling isolated (Kim, Kim, and Han 2011)", " In line with the previous research, this study posits two hypotheses among senior SM users in the tourism domain:  H;: Self-expression has a positive effect on bonding social capital_  H,: Self-expression has a positive effect on bridging social capital_  2_1_9_ Relationship between enjoyment, bonding social capital, and bridging social capital  Enjoyment is defined as \u201cthe positive affects that accompany obtaining or having the material objects or action opportunities one wishes to possess or to experience\u2019 (Waterman, Schwartz, and Conti 2008, 42)", " Accordingly, this research proposes the following two hypotheses among senior SM users in the tourism area:  H,: Enjoyment has a positive effect on bonding social capital_  Hg: Enjoyment has a positive effect on bridging social capital_  2_1_10_ Relationship between bonding social capital, bridging social capital, and SM involvement Understanding users\u2019 involvement in SM can help explain their contributions to websites (Sigala 2012)", " These findings imply that SM users with high social capital (bonding, bridging, or both) are more involved in SM than users with low bonding and/or bridging social capital_ Accordingly, we propose the following two hypotheses among seniors using SM for tourism:  H7: Bonding social capital has a positive effect on SM involvement", "  Hg: Bridging social capital has a positive effect on SM involvement", " In addition, we hypothesise that avoidance attachment moderates the relationships between antecedents (helping, _ selfexpression, and enjoyment) and social capital (both bonding and bridging):  H,,: Seniors\u2019 avoidance attachment moderates the relationship between helping and bonding social capital for seniors using SM for tourism-related purposes", "  H,,: Seniors\u2019 avoidance attachment moderates the relationship between helping and bridging social capital for seniors

with users' attitude toward viral movements (H1) and the tone of emotional content (H2)_  Researchers have recently begun examining the content characteristics that drive diffusion and persistence (Naab & Sehl, 2017)", " Considering the content characteristics of social-media communication, we hypothesize that users feel emotions when content is meaningful (H3), resulting in positive attitudes toward sharing (H4)_  Berger and Milkman (2010) also found that the link that connects emotion to social transmission transcends valence, stating that physiological arousal motivates diffusion", " Therefore, when content is meaningful and evokes emotions, it is arguable that users are more likely to feel arousal emotions (H5), resulting in a positive attitude toward sharing (H6)_  Brandtzzeg (2010), based on an examination of media-user typologies, suggested that Internet users can be sorted into \u201cnon-users,\u201d \u201csporadics,\u201d \u201cdebaters,\u201d \u201centertainment

personas are likely to participate (H7) and share viral content (H8)_  99 66  3_ Material and methods  Existing eWoM and viral-marketing-communication research have mainly focused on comment type, credibility, and comparing the communication of positive and negative content (Bao, Wang, Wang, Wu, & Lau, 2016; Boo & Kim, 2013; Shao et al_, 2017)", "  The remaining coefficient paths indicate that emotion has a small positive impact on arousal (0_053), supporting H5, and that arousal has a positive impact on attitude toward viral communication, confirming H6_ Further, the positive impact of emotion tone on attitude toward viral content supports H4_ Content meaningfulness positively affects both arousal and emotion tone constructs, confirming H3_ On the other hand, social pressure positively influences willingness to participate in viral-communication processes, confirming H1_ Social pressures (perceived peer influence on participants' social sharing behaviors and perception of participants' own influence on others' sharing behaviors) positively affected willingness to participate in viral communications, supporting H7_ However, contrary to our prediction (H6a and H\u00a78), willingness to participate, as well as attitude toward viral content, did not positively affect willingness to share content", " These results suggest that social pressures have a greater influence on Heavy Users, reinforcing the notion that more established digital social personas are most likely to participate in viral communication (H7)_  5_ Discussion and conclusions  Previous studies have

Keywords: green space; mental health and wellbeing; exposome     1_ Introduction  Several reviews have highlighted the positive association between green space (GS) and mental health and wellbeing (HWB)_ These reviews have generally focused on GS in a narrow sense, such as forest therapy [1,2], community GS [3,4], or urban GS [5-7], and a number of reviews have looked at GS in relation to urbanicity and urban planning [8,9]", " The reviews generally identify positive associations between the narrowly defined GS investigated and measures of mental HWB_  Design of and access to GS is particularly relevant in cities where GS, among other social and environmental factors, is under pressure due to urbanization [19]", " Public Health 2019, 16, 2081 2 of 49  of research studies with a

also been shown to be associated with mental HWB in rural areas [25-28]", " Other studies investigating associations between mental HWB and GS in rural areas have found a significant relationship with rurality [30,31]", "  There is increasing interest in understanding the factors that may make GS beneficial for HWB [46]", " The developing concept of the exposome [47] encompasses the totality of exposures we face as humans, from conception onwards, and the combined effect of these exposures on HWB_ An exposome approach to investigating GS could help us understand exactly what is beneficial for mental HWB_  We have carried out a scoping study to map the available literature on different types of GS, including the context and co-exposures, and their associations with mental HWB,

different environments have a positive effect on mental HWB (RQ 1 & 3);  e Fora variety of different groups of people (RQ 4), GS does have a positive effect on mental HWB;  e Different types of GS

The attempt in this review, to look at context and co-exposures, has highlighted a gap in the available literature; our knowledge on contextual factors and co-exposures in relation to the GS

that, in future research, the entire GS exposome should be considered when investigating the impact on mental HWB_ There is a need for large well-designed randomized controlled crossover trails that

of Harding and He [2015], investors in a good mood are more risk tolerant, which increases their appetite for equity investments and decreases their interest in fixed income, buying shares and  pushing up stocks prices, while the opposite occurs in situations of pessimism, fear, or even panic", "  Hypothesis  Based on the year and a half track record in which InvestMood systems have been

photos and short videos that currently boasts more than 800 million international users (Instagram 2017; Jang, Han, Shih, & Lee, 2015)", " While HNB promotion has yet to be examined on Instagram, previous research has used Instagram\u2019s Application Programming Interface (API) to collect data on posts that included hashtags associated with e-cigarettes, and examined differences in content between account types (Laestadius, Wahl, & Cho, 2016) and user interactions (Chu, Allem, Cruz, & Unger, 2016)", " Given the potential behavioral influence of exposure to tobacco promotion on social media, it is important to understand how HNB content are shared on Instagram including health, cessation, flavors, and other messages pertaining to public health", " Due to its visual storytelling capacity, Instagram is particularly well suited for examining both how people discuss and use HNB products in their photos compared to more text driven social media platforms", " The proposed study will use Instagram\u2019s API to examine image content of HNB posts, general textual topics and larger themes related to these textual topics, public health relevant topics, and  different types of Instagram users who post HNB tobacco content", " A list of hashtags related to HNB products was generated via a \u2018snowball\u2019 method (Goodman, 1961), which began with an API request for the

posted about fashion choices, including pairing clothes with different HNB components including colored caps and device skins (decorative stickers)", " For instance, after reviewing posts with \u201c#kid\u2019, it was clear this hashtag referred to a specific brand of HNB skins", " In addition to skins, users posted customized accessories, such as HeatStick (rolled tobacco leaf used in IQOS) cases, bags, and ashtrays to reflect their interests beyond tobacco use and contribute to a stylized aesthetic associated with HNB products on Instagram", " Moreover, hashtags were used as a means of associating HNB products with \u201c#luxury\u201d and \u201c#superiority\u2019", " In sum, the  \u201cAppearance\u201d theme featured posts of customized HNB products indexed under fashion

users looking to purchase HNB products to easily find retailers (see Table 3)", " To summarize, a unifying component of the \u201cMarketing\u201d theme was the use of Instagram posts to generate sales of HNB devices and  accessories", " This theme was comprised of more generic HNB product terms than the other themes", " Often these posts were used to showcase or critique HNB products", " For example, one HNB user posted an image of their IQOS next to a carton of purple menthol and described the flavor (see Table 3 and supplemental Figure 1)", " Other posts compared HNB products to cigarettes and suggested HNB wereuseful for smoking cessation", " Posts associated HNB with a healthy lifestyle and reiterated the 90% reduction in harmful constituents, a finding touted by PMI (see

user types: HNB user (n=2,249), IQOS retail employee (n=251), fan community (n=32), and online retailer (n=3,809)", " HNB users posted images of themselves and customized IQOS devices with hashtags to describe the brand of skin and HNB device", " With no official manufacturer accounts observed, these users acted as content creators on behalf of the HNB manufacturer", " Fan community accounts posted images of HNB cases in various locations and adorned with a variety of designs", " These users primarily reposted curated stylized images of people using HNB devices paired with vehicles, alcohol, luxury items, food, and models", " Online retailers used hashtag terms to market and associate their accounts and HNB devices within broad categories of content on Instagram including luxurious, fashionable, and customizable products", " These accounts typically posted images of HNB devices or accessories  for sale with contact information and prices", "The prevalence of health terms in posts among the different types of users included: 9_4% of fan community users, 4% HNB users, 3_6% online retailers, and 2_8% IQOS retail employees", " Similarly, 8_3% of HNB users, 6_5% of online retailers, 6_3% of fan communities, and 3_6% of IQOS retail employees posted terms associated with smoking cessation", " The prevalence of users who posted regarding the smell of using HNB products was relatively even across user types including 6_9% of HNB users, 6_7% of online retailers, 6_3% of fan communities, and 4_8% of IQOS retail employees", " Finally, the convenience of HNB products was emphasized by 7_4% of HNB users, 6_3% of fan communities, 5_8% of online retailers, and 1_6% of IQOS retail  employees", " For example, online retailers, who make up 60% of users, consistently represented about 60% of users who posted under each public health topic followed by HNB users (about 36%), IQOS retail employees (about 3%), and fan communities (about 1%)", " Thus, while the proportion of users posting with public health relevant terms may be similar across the different user types, the majority of posts  with these terms were by online retailers and HNB users", "  In summary, four types of users were identified in this study\u2019s HNB Instagram hashtag network including: HNB user, IQOS retail employee, fan community, and online retailer", " There were far more online retailers and HNB users than IQOS retail employees and fan community accounts represented in the HNB dataset and these users, due to their prevalence, accounted for  the majority of posts with public health relevant topics", "  4_ DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to examine the promotion of HNB products and we did so by studying HNB content on Instagram", " Many of our results we expected: HNB users posted images of their HNB devices on Instagram and fan communities were dedicated to posting images of HNB devices", " However, textual and GCV analyses of HNB posts on Instagram helped us to discover a popular aspect of HNB devices are the ability to customize the HNB cases, tips, and skins and the framing of these devices as fashion accessories", " Moreover, the GCV label categories \u201csocial group\u201d, \u201cbeauty\u201d, and \u201cphotography\u201d indicate HNB posts feature stylized images of friend groups and models that suggest social acceptability and normalcy of HNB products", " Further, a large proportion of users posting about HNB devices are online retailers who use Instagram as a vehicle to reach potential customers and sell HNB devices and accessories", " While not very widespread (about 4% to 7% of posts), online retailers and HNB users promoted HNB devices as convenient, healthy, less smelly, flavorful, and for smoking cessation", " In addition to accessibilityof HNB products via Instagram, youth exposure to messages that normalize and tout HNB products as healthy alternatives to smoking is concerning as these  products become more available", "  The present study extends previous research with analysis of visual content, textual topics and themes, public health relevant topics, and types of users associated with HNB content on Instagram", " For example, Allem et al_ (2018) found a large proportion of e-cigarette liquid posts on Instagram were by manufacturers (67_8%), similar to HNB online retailers in the current study (60%)", " This theme is like retailer posts categorized under the current study\u2019s theme \u201cMarketing\u201d that featured retailer contact information pasted over an image of a HNB device", " Moreover, the \u201cAppearance\u201d theme and the GCV label \u201cfashion accessory\u201d in this study are similar to LDA discovered topics named \u201cFashion/beauty\u201d and \u201cProduct\u201d from a corpora of general Instagram posts collected in 2015 (Jang et al_, 2015) and fashion has been described as a general category of posted content on Instagram (Hu, Manikonda, & Kambhampati, 2014)", " It is important to surveil the influence of HNB promotion messages found inthis study on vulnerable populations such as adolescents", " Of primary concern is exposure to HNB promotions may influence use of these products by youth and transitions to combustible tobacco use, as has been found among adolescent e-cigarette users (Barrington-Trimis et al_,  2016; Wills et al_, 2016)", " Further, the user type categories are not exhaustive and there could be other types of users who post HNB content such as friends of HNB users", " In sum, we are confident our data included a variety of HNB content on Instagram and the analyses were  sufficient for our study\u2019s purpose", "  4_2 Conclusions  HNB are the newest class of tobacco product that may be appealing to the core demographics of Instagram users - young, interested in style/fashion, and active consumers (Jang et al_, 2015)", " Our study demonstrated, HNB promotion on Instagram is overwhelmingly online retailer and HNB user generated buoyed by fan communities and IQOS employees (Richardson, Ganz, & Vallone, 2015)", " The prevalence of online retailers, indexing HNB under style/fashion categories, and use of health, flavor, and cessation terms are important to consider when these products enter the U_S_ market as underaged youth may have access to HNB products and exposure to biased messaging through Instagram", "2017_04_003  Hu, Y", "php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/viewFile/8118/8087  Hyam, R", ", Han, K", " Authors were considered \u201cHNB users\u201d if they were not coded as a \u201cIQOS retail employee\u201d, \u201cFan community\u201d, or \u201conline retailer\u201d, 61 authors were unable to be verified and were dropped from the user analyses", " The percentages are not independent because

involvement, and opinion leadership  Seunga Venus Jin School of Business, Sejong University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, and  Ehri Ryu Department of Psychology, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, USA  Abstract  Purpose \u2014 In light of Facebook-based viral marketing and social commerce, the purpose of this paper is to test the moderating role of social identification with the Facebook profile owner (celebrity as aspirational reference group vs ingroup member (college student, same school) vs outgroup member (college student, different school)) in Facebook-based fashion brand marketing and management", " As a productive tool for marketing and branding, social commerce enhances interconnectivity among consumers, facilitates interpersonal interaction between consumers and brands and provides brands with unique opportunities to co-create value with consumers, in the process of building trust in emerging e-commerce platforms (Hajli, 2014b; Hew et al, 2016)", " Based on the theoretical rationales discussed so far, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1_ Social identification with the celebrity and ingroup vs outgroup perception will moderate the effects of consumers\u2019 (a) materialism, (b) fashion involvement and (c) opinion leadership on persuasion outcomes (advertising effectiveness, emotional responses to advertisements, willingness to buy the endorsed products and interpersonal attraction to/wishful identification with the brand endorser) in Facebook advertising-based fashion marketing and management", " It is hypothesized that source credibility perception plays a mediating role in explaining the relationship between experimental manipulations and the dependent variables:  H2a_ Consumers\u2019 perceived source credibility of the celebrity with her own brand will mediate the relationship between ingroup vs outgroup perception and the outcome variables in Facebook advertising-based fashion marketing and management", "  H2b_ Consumers\u2019 perceived source credibility of the Facebook profile owner will mediate the relationship between ingroup vs outgroup perception and the outcome variables in Facebook advertising-based fashion marketing and management", " Social identification with the celebrity (SIDc) was measured with four items from social identity scale (Reed et al_, 2007) (e_g_ \u201cHow much do you feel you identify with the celebrity above", "\u201d \u201cHow important is the celebrity to your sense of who you are", "  Interaction effects between experimental conditions and consumers\u2019 materiahsm, fashion involvement and opinion leadership (H1a\u2014H10)  Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the moderating effects of the experimental manipulations (H7a\u2014H1c; Aiken and West, 1991)", "  Wishful identification (WID) 3 0_930 I had like to do the kinds of things the celebrity endorser above does  Social identification (SID) 4 0_899 How much do you feel you identify with the celebrity above", "  The experimental conditions moderated the influence of materialism on interpersonal attraction to the celebrity, wishful identification with the celebrity, social identification with the celebrity, ingroup vs outgroup perception of the celebrity, emotional quotient and willingness to buy (H7a, shown in Figure 2); moderated the influence of fashion involvement on interpersonal attraction to the celebrity, wishful identification, emotional quotient and involvement with ad 2 (H7b, shown in Figure 3); and moderated the influence of opinion leadership on emotional quotient, willingness to buy and advertising believability (H1c, shown in Figure 4), thus supporting Hla\u2014H1c, respectively", "  Mediating effects of source credibihty perception (H2a and H2b) Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediation effects of the source credibility (72a and H2b)_ Mplus 7_4 was used (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n, 1998-2015)", " The source credibility of the celebrity mediated the effects of the experimental conditions on interpersonal attraction to the celebrity, social identification with the celebrity and involvement with ad 1, thus supporting H2a (shown in Figure 5)", " The source credibility of the Facebook profile owner mediated the effects of the experimental conditions on interpersonal attraction to the celebrity, advertising believability 2, and involvement with ad 3, thus supporting H2b (shown in Figure 6)", " In Figure 6(b), the Facebook profile owner expertise was higher in SJJ condition compared to OJJ and OOJ conditions, and the higher expertise in SJJ condition was related to higher AB2_ In Figure 6(c), the Facebook profile owner goodwill was lower in SJJ condition than in OJJ and OOJ conditions, and the lower goodwill in

consistently in The New York Times than have been mixed ethnicity and other ethnicity, which were introduced in the late 20th century", " In support of Hypothesis 1, trends in this figure illustrate that terms that include culture are relatively new in usage, experiencing growing popularity in recent years", "  To elaborate on the findings consistent with Hypothesis 1, terms with \u2014racial suffixes were often first to be introduced to the NY Times, followed by terms with \u2014cultural suffixes and those with \u2014ethnic suffixes", " As seen in Figure 2, between identity terms signifying two identities (e_g_, bicultural), interracial was the first term to be incorporated into the NY Times followed by biracial_ These two terms were the most highly frequent terms of the term cluster from their incorporation into the NY Times until 2015_ This finding is consistent with Hypothesis 1, as we predicted that terms with \u2014racial suffixes would be the earliest terms to appear in a source intended for lay audiences", " These trends are noted in Figure 5_  Hypothesis 2: Tested with the NY Times and Reddit  Hypothesis 2 concerns the comparison of trends for high frequency social identity terms in the NY Times and Reddit", "  Hypothesis 3: Tested with Google Books N-Grams, the NY Times, PsycINFO, NSF Grant Database, NIH Grant Database and Reddit  Hypothesis 3 concerns an expected time lag in the adoption of identity terms between sources aimed at lay audiences and those targeted at mixed and academic audiences", " In line with Hypothesis 3, there was a time lag in the transmission of identity terms across categorization clusters (see Table 1) concerning their usage and implementation in specific corpora (see Table 2)", " The exponential trend displayed in the figure demonstrates that the total number of psychology publications doubled approximately every 15_5 years, represented  by the following equation: y = 2200 \u2014 122_79_ Similarly, the number of psychology publications on PsycINFO that include target identity terms has exponentially increased over time, signified by the  3x equation: y = 2500 \u2014 283_06_ Consistent with Hypothesis 3, this trend illustrates that psychology publications with selected identity terms have doubled in number every 6_8 years, a figure twice that of the overall rate of total psychology publication production", " However, overall, results support Hypothesis 3 that the selected identity terms were first adopted by sources or corpora with lay audiences before their adoption and frequent usage in academic sources, such as NIH grants", " Overall, consistent with Hypothesis 3, selected cultural identity terms were first introduced to Google Books N-Grams, followed by The New York Times and academic sources, including PsycINFO, NSF, and NIH grant databases", "  Overall, this study tested three hypotheses about the usage and frequency of social identity terms within the NY Times (Hypothesis 1), across the NY Times and Reddit (Hypothesis 2) and across Google Books N-Grams, the NY Times, PsycINFO, NSF Grant Database, NIH Grant Database, and Reddit (Hypothesis 3)", " In this case, monocultural was the first and most prevalent term used to describe individuals with one identity, followed by monoethnic and monoracial_  As demonstrated in a test of Hypothesis 2, which compared the usage of identity terms with the highest frequency across time in lay sources (the NY Times and Reddit), terms representing bicultural and multicultural identities are most contemporary and frequent in usage than those representing monocultural identities", "  Furthermore, as observed in the examination of Hypothesis 2, there was an upsurge in the usage of the terms, multicultural and multiculturalism, which seems to relate to the increased racial diversification of the U_S_ population as well as to individuals identifying with more than two identities", "  In addition to theorizing about the evolution of selected identity terms, in accordance with Hypothesis 3, we theorized that the transmission of these terms would begin in sources intended for lay audiences, be relayed to mixed sources, and would, finally, be transmitted to academic sources", "  As predicted in Hypothesis 3, identity terms were first employed, and exhibited at a high proportional frequency in sources intended for lay audiences before being utilized in academic sources", " As issues of diversity and social identification are significant topics of study around the world, it will be fruitful for future research in

Abstract  Objectives: Social media messages have been increasingly used in health campaigns about prevention, testing, and treatment of HIV_ We identified factors leading to the retransmission of messages from expert social media accounts to create data-driven recommendations for online HIV messaging", "  Design and Methods: We sampled 20,201 HIV-related tweets (posted between 2010 and 2017) from 37 HIV experts", " These findings were similar for messages authored by HIV experts as well as messages retransmitted by experts but created by non-experts (e_g_, celebrities or politicians)", "  Conclusions: Fear appeals affect how much HIV messages spread on Twitter, as do structural characteristics like the length of the tweet and inclusion of images", "  Keywords  HIV; health communication; health education; social media; Twitter messaging  Introduction  Posting messages on Twitter is free, fast, and holds the potential of reaching up to 330 million monthly active users [1] (20% of US Americans report using Twitter [2]) \u2014 it is no wonder that health professionals are using Twitter and other social media to disseminate messages about HIV_ As early as 2010, almost a third of sexual health social media campaigns had a Twitter presence [3]", "1diosnue~= JOUINY }diosnuep JouINY }duosnuep JOUINY  1disoOSsnuey JOUINY  LOHMANN et al_  Page 2  however, no study has systematically examined how much these expert-vetted messages in the area of HIV are spread online", " How often a message is shared is thus a good metric of message success [4] both because it indicates a positive attitude towards the message and because it widens the message\u2019s potential audience", " In this paper, we analyzed dissemination of over twenty-five thousand expert-delivered HIV messages on Twitter by analyzing factors that predict greater message dissemination measured as higher retweet counts", "gov which has 375,000 followers, received fewer than 11 retweets per message (excluding one non-HIV related tweet that was retweeted from @HealthCareGov)", " How can this potential be achieved", " For instance, focus groups of female Black college students have recommended including pictures and other fear-inducing visuals in media messages for HIV prevention [10]", " In non-HIV specific tweets, features such as hashtags and URLs, as well as higher numbers of followers per account, were associated with higher retweet counts [11]", " To obtain a clear split between experts\u2019 posts and nonexperts\u2019 posts, as well as between retweets and original messages, we divided the data into three groups: Original messages posted by the experts in our sample, messages they had retweeted from other HIV experts that we did not sample for, and messages they had retweeted from non-experts (incl", "  Data Collection  We trained six research assistants to find HIV experts who also are Twitter users by searching conference programs, NIH staff directories, NGO websites, and HIV-related hashtags", " Trained research assistants manually annotated 900 tweets from the selected accounts to classify whether each tweet was about HIV and/or about other STIs", " Based on these human annotations, we developed two SVM models (one to predict whether a new tweet is about HIV, one for STIs)", " A direct comparison between the SVM classifier\u2019s predicted values (using 10-fold cross validation) and human-annotated values showed satisfactory performance, HIV: precision (true positives divided by all tweets  1Note that this applies only to unmodified retweets", "97_ We thus used the SVM classifier\u2019s predicted values to exclude tweets that were neither about HIV nor other STIs, thus removing other topics that garner many retweets (e_g_, politics) to assure the validity of our data", " a community focus, and a number of binary content domain variables: Teenagers and/or young adults, Black and/or Latino/a populations, transgender individuals, men who have sex with men, HIV, or other STIs (see section \u201cData Filtering\u201d)", "  The retweets from non-experts received much higher retweet counts than messages retweeted from HIV experts, which in turn were retweeted more often than original messages posted by our sample of HIV experts (Table 1)", "  The impurity and permutation tests showed that follower and friend counts of the Twitter user (account-level predictors) and word count, HIV content, and emotional sentiment (tweet-level predictors) emerged as the most influential predictors of retweet counts (see (supplement, Table $1)", "  Incidence Rate Ratios  Based on these results and prior literature on tweet characteristics, we created a model with fear, trust, word count, hashtag count, visual content, URL use, and HIV content as tweetlevel predictors", " Fourth, the effect of hashtags was significant only among the expert retweets but overall indicated that more hashtags may be related to more dissemination, which may be attributed to increased viewership in communities interested in HIV content", "  Finally, even the most-disseminated messages from HIV experts reached nowhere as many retweets as messages from Obama, Rihanna, Bill Gates, Elton John, or the WHO did", "  We propose a set of recommendations that HIV experts and organizations may use to shape their social media presence (Table 2)", " Give

Perceived Risk, and HIV-Associated Behaviors Among Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex With Men in the United States  Akshay Sharma, MBBS, MPH, PhD'\u201d\u2019(\u00ae, Erin M", "\u201d  Abstract  Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in the United States remain heavily impacted by HIV_ The purpose of this study was to describe intergenerational differences in functional knowledge of HIV prevention strategies, perceived risk, recent condomless anal sex (CAS), and HIV testing behavior", " Eight hundred sexually active GBMSM were recruited via Facebook from August to September 2015, and administered a Webbased survey which included |2 multiple-choice questions to elicit data regarding functional knowledge of different HIV prevention approaches (e_g_, condom use, pre-exposure prophylaxis post-exposure prophylaxis, treatment as prevention, circumcision)", " Younger generations were equally concerned about contracting HIV as their older counterparts", " Finally, birth cohort variations with respect to engaging in CAS with 22 men in the past 3 months and testing for HIV in the past year were not markedly pronounced", " Younger GBMSM might be more knowledgeable about HIV prevention strategies compared to their predecessors, but are equally concerned about contracting HIV_ Researchers and practitioners should consider intergenerational and other demographic differences while designing multifaceted HIV prevention programs for GBMSM", "  Keywords HIV infections, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual and gender minorities, sexual behavior, risk reduction behavior  Received April 3, 2018; revised June 21, 2018; accepted June 26, 2018     Since initial reports in the early 1980s of what would  become the HIV epidemic in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 1981; Haverkos & Curran, 1982), gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) have been disproportionately impacted", " HIV incidence among GBMSM steadily increased from approximately 20,000 per year in the early 1990s to approximately 30,000 per year in the mid-2000s (CDC, 2012; Hall et al_, 2008)", "Sharma et al_  1825     annual HIV incidence has recently stabilized (Hall et al_, 2017), the overall burden of disease in this risk group remains high (CDC, 2017)", " The field of HIV prevention has been repeatedly transformed over the past 30 years, with different generations of GBMSM being exposed to multiple risk-reduction interventions", "  Intervention development has often been guided by theoretical frameworks such as the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model (Fisher & Fisher, 1992), which conceptualizes risk reduction as a function of one\u2019s knowledge of HIV (including its prevention, prognosis, and treatment), motivation to reduce risk, and behavioral skills to adopt specific health-promoting strategies", " Public health research has traditionally focused on basic measurements of knowledge including facts and misconceptions surrounding HIV (Kelly, Lawrence, Hood, & Brasfield, 1989), and being aware of the most common routes of transmission (Sonenstein, Pleck, & Ku, 1989)", " Functional knowledge refers to health literacy beyond just basic awareness of an illness, and high levels have been associated with better health outcomes in people living with HIV (Kalichman & Rompa, 2000; Walker, Hong, Talavera, Verduzco, & Woods, 2017)", " Given the evolving landscape of HIV prevention, intergenerational differences in functional knowledge of different approaches might exist", " Increasing calls to formulate effective HIV prevention packages for GBMSM of all ages necessitates a better understanding of how functional knowledge levels vary across generations (Sullivan et al_, 2012)", "  Advances in antiretroviral medications over the past two decades have been hypothesized to contribute to the emergence of \u201ctreatment optimism\u201d (Huebner, Rebchook, & Kegeles, 2004; Sullivan, Drake, & Sanchez, 2007), described as \u201cfeeling less concerned about acquiring HIV  because of medications that can reduce HIV-related mortality and morbidity\u201d (Schwarcz et al_, 2007)", " Lower risk perceptions have in turn been associated with a greater engagement in risky sexual behaviors like CAS (Ostrow et al_, 2002; Paz-Bailey et al_, 2016), and a reduction in preventive behaviors like HIV testing (CDC, 2016b; White & Stephenson, 2016)", " Researchers have also raised concerns about \u201cHIV prevention fatigue\u201d among GBMSM, a viewpoint that messages, programs, or services have become monotonous over the years (Stockman et al_, 2004)", " Identifying intergenerational variations can help appropriately tailor content while designing and evaluating novel HIV prevention interventions for this risk group", " This study sought to quantify levels of functional knowledge of traditional and contemporary prevention strategies among sexually active GBMSM in the United States, and their overall concern about contracting HIV, that is, perceived risk", " Birth cohort and other demographic differences in functional knowledge, perceived HIV risk, as well as associated behaviors including recently engaging in CAS with multiple partners and HIV testing were also evaluated", "  Twelve multiple-choice questions were used to gather data regarding functional knowledge of HIV prevention strategies (e_g_, condom use, PrEP, PEP, TasP, circumcision), whose specifics are readily available on the CDC\u2019s HIV/AIDS Website (CDC, 2018)", " Perceived HIV risk was collected as an ordinal measure with 0 representing the least amount of overall concern about contracting HIV and 10 representing the greatest amount of concern (Marcus, Gassowski, & Drewes, 2016)", " The survey also included questions pertaining to recent engagement in potentially high-risk sexual behavior, and HIV testing history", " Data on ever being

higher knowledge levels (adjusted odds for the three youngest cohorts were 60%-70% higher compared to the oldest cohort), but no differences were observed with respect to perceived HIV risk", " These results suggest that although younger GBMSM might be relatively more knowledgeable, possibly due to greater media exposure or access to latest information about HIV  prevention and treatment options, they are just as concerned about contracting HIV as their older counterparts who experienced the full brutality of the epidemic", " This is encouraging in the contexts of \u201cHIV prevention fatigue\u201d and \u201ctreatment optimism\u201d documented among young GBMSM (Huebner et al_, 2004; Stockman et al_, 2004), as well as in light of growing apprehensions about their complacency surrounding HIV (CDC, 2016a; MacKellarSharma et al_  1831     et al_, 2011)", " This also highlights the need to improve HIV prevention messaging for older, sexually active GBMSM", "  Regarding functional knowledge of HIV prevention strategies, majority of the participants (n = 499, 62_4%) scored >7 of 12 questions correct (median: 7; interquartile range: 6-8; range: 1-12)", " Given the steady increases in HIV diagnoses among non-Hispanic Black/African American GBMSM over the past decade (CDC, 2016d), targeted efforts are needed to inform them within the framework of social factors influencing their risk (Peterson & Jones, 2009)", " Simplifying media messages about traditional and contemporary HIV prevention approaches, with a greater emphasis on visual representation and _ interactivity (Megan, Jennifer, Ayala, & Ellen, 2012), might help improve levels of functional knowledge among participants with lower educational attainment", " Participants reporting a bisexual/other sexual orientation were less knowledgeable about HIV prevention strategies, possibly reflecting the lack of programmatic attention directed towards this subgroup (Doll & Beeker, 1996)", " Another reason could be relatively lower levels of discussion around HIV among men who do not identify as homosexual/gay (Goldbaum et al_, 1998)", "  Regarding overall concern about contracting HIV, majority of the participants (n = 482, 60_3%) indicated their perceived risk to be >-6 on a scale of 0 to 10 (median: 7; interquartile range: 3-8; range: 0-10)", " Risk appraisal is a complex analytical and emotional assessment process (Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004), which includes a personal evaluation of the prevalence of HIV within one\u2019s community (White & Stephenson, 2016)", " Consistent with previous research (Klein & Tilley, 2012; MacKellar et al_, 2007), participants who had completed college or earned higher degrees were less concerned about contracting HIV_ Those who were primarily partnered had lower HIV risk perceptions, which is analogous to a recent national study in which GBMSM in main partnerships were more likely to perceive zero risk of HIV infection, and felt very confident of remaining HIVnegative (Stephenson, White, Darbes, Hoff, & Sullivan, 2015)", " Given that global measures of perceived HIV susceptibility might be better predictors of actual risk than simple behavioral indicators (MacKellar et al_, 2005,  2007), providers offering HIV prevention services to GBMSM should consider evaluating their clients\u2019 risk perceptions to enhance the personalized decision-making process", " Increasing functional knowledge of HIV prevention strategies was associated with recently engaging in CAS with multiple partners", " The IMB model recognizes that information and motivation could be independent of each other, as observed when wellinformed individuals are not motivated to change behaviors that increase their HIV risk (Fisher & Fisher, 2000)", " This is a disconcerting observation because CAS increases the risk of STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis (CDC, 2016c), regardless of one\u2019s use of medications to prevent HIV (Grant et al_, 2010)", "  No intergenerational differences were observed with respect to HIV testing in this study", " This is reassuring, given the estimated 20% increase in HIV infections in this demographic stratum from 2008 to 2014 (CDC, 2017)", " Increasing risk perceptions among the participants were positively associated with HIV testing, similar to prior observations (Grover & Miller, 2014; Tillman & Mark, 2015; White & Stephenson, 2016)", " The observation that participants who recently engaged in CAS with >2 men were more likely to have been tested for HIV might be reflective of an event-driven testing pattern (Lorenc et al_, 2011; Maguen, Armistead, & Kalichman, 2000)", " Alternatively, this relationship could indicate behavioral disinhibition among GBMSM who have tested negative for HIV, which is a cause for concern given the rising STI rates in this subgroup (CDC, 2016c)", " Finally, although an attempt was made to formulate an exhaustive list of questions for assessing functional knowledge of HIV prevention strategies, the authors acknowledge that this question set might not be complete", "  Conclusion  Results of this study have important implications for furthering HIV prevention efforts among sexually active GBMSM in the United States", " Younger generations might be more knowledgeable about HIV prevention strategies compared to their predecessors, but are equally concerned about contracting HIV_ Researchers and practitioners should consider these important issues while designing combination prevention interventions for GBMSM", " Additional research is needed to evaluate whether their awareness translates into actual use, and to better understand how their risk perceptions influence behaviors such

Leisurely (passive-aggressive PD); Bold (narcissistic PD); Mischievous (antisocial PD); Colorful (histrionic PD); Imaginative (schizotypal PD); Diligent (obsessive-compulsive PD); and Dutiful (dependent PD)", " The HDS offers a broader perspective on dysfunctional dispositions", " Therefore, analyzing the relationship between HDS scores and online language may reveal a more nuanced relationship across more dimensions", " In addition, given the criterion validity of the HDS, it stands to reason that predicting negative dispositions online may generalize to behavior in the workplace (Back et al_, 2010; Buckels, Trapnell, & Paulhus, 2014)", " This paper sought to address these limitations by using the HDS as an alternative measure of the dark side and Facebook posts as an alternative source of language", " Using the HDS to assess eleven dysfunctional personality dimensions, we aimed to not only replicate the relationship between language and scales that are analogous with the Dark Triad (e_g_ the Bold, Skeptical & Mischievous scales), but also extend such understanding through the analyses of dimensions that have been overlooked by researchers and may be of interest to I-O psychologists, HR practitioners and organizational leaders", " Each quiz contained two personality scales from the HDS_ After completing the quiz, participants received positive

LIWC predictors had a mean and standard deviation around zero, and were mostly skewed to the right", " The change in fit for other scales ranged between 0_06 and 0_08_  Exploring the extent to which language could predict HDS scores, the average test R was 0_16 for the OLS and LASSO models, with fit ranging from negligible (Cautious, R= 0_06; Colorful R = 0_07, Leisurely R = 0_08), to small (Diligent R = 0_10; Mischievous R = 0_13; Skeptical R = 0_16), to moderate (Imaginative & Reserved R = 0_21; Bold R = 0_22; Dutiful R = 0_25; Excitable R = 0_27)", "  Table 3 contains the standardized

suggests that men display a higher propensity to support populist parties, and that political engagement on social media\u2014at least in its basic form, such as the action of liking contents\u2014is not affected by gender gap, we also expect to find a similar pattern in the Facebook environment:  Hypothesis 1 (H1): Men are more likely to \u201clike\u201d Facebook posts by populist parties or

audience (namely, users who like the post), irrespective of the type of party endorsing it", " On the other hand, the difference between the MPPs and the radical ones (H2) is not significant", " Hypothesis 3 is thus corroborated, leading us to state that, irrespective of the nature of the party, populist communication always masculinizes the active, like-giving audience", "  By using the

According to the literature a game-like atmosphere in which students would be free to participate, form groups, collaborate, play with ideas and compete, without the fear of penalties or punishment,

generation, Generation Z, is born into the era of information technology and social media, smartphones, tablets and mobility, and uses them for everything: from getting information to staying in touch with family and friends (Hall, 2016)", " Researchers acknowledge that ICT today is not just the mere vehicle to deliver instruction but when more modern applications are employed technology affects profoundly the learning process and achievement (Schmid et al_, 2014) and several studies and metaanalyses suggest that there is a strong positive connection between information technology, student engagement and beneficial learning outcomes (Chen, Lambert, & Guidry, 2010; Kuh & Hu, 2001; Liao, 2007; Means et al_, 2009; Merchant, Goetz, Cifuentes, Keeney-Kennicutt, & Davis, 2014)", " In respect

1_ After the intervention students will perform better in creativity tests", " Hypothesis 2_ Academic achievement and creativity of students will be positively linked", " Hypothesis 3_ Students with higher ICT knowledge and use will be more creative", "  Hypothesis 4_ Creativity of students with higher ICT knowledge and use will be more enhanced after the intervention compared to their

time, social media use and social media contacts were used as predictors to test five hypotheses, each associated with four sub-hypotheses relating to (a) social media time, real world off line, (b) social activity, real world off line, (c) social media use (on line) and (d) social media contacts (on line):  H1_ Increased (a) social time, (b) social activity, (c) social media use and (d) more

 The status of all five hypotheses is summarised in Table 5_ Discounting social time, H1 (on predicting total network size) was supported for all predictor variables", "  Regarding H2 (on predicting

Communication Studies and Psychology, have been dominated by a focus on close friends or, less commonly, overall networks", " Further, it seems likely that analyses of technology effects in HCI and neighbouring disciplines would benefit significantly by taking note of these findings", " The classification of ties we adopted was motivated by Dunbar's SBH, so this was bound to introduce some incompatibility with the many previous interpretations of close friends, strong and weak ties (Granovetter, 1983; Wellman et al_, 2001; Hays, 1989)", " Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,

our lives as unproductive, feel guilt about our past, or feel that we did not accomplish our life goals, we become dissatisfied with life and develop despair, often leading to depression and hopelessness", " Given these operationalizations and the prior research we reviewed above, we state the following hypotheses:  H1_ Age will be negatively related to GSS respondents affirming that they have ever felt that they were going to have a nervous breakdown", "  H2_ The number of social media outlets one uses will be positively related to GSS respondents affirming that they have ever felt that they were going to have a nervous breakdown", "  H3_ The relationship between the number of social media outlets one uses and GSS respondents saying they have felt like they were going to have a

all age groups (e_g_ Shakya & Christakis, 2017), overall social media use is positively and significantly related to respondents affirming that they have felt that they were going to have a nervous breakdown (b=0_20, OR= 1_22, p < 0_05, zero-order coefficient without controls: b=0_26, OR=1_30, p<0_001, Negelkerke R", " The relationship between social media and self-reporting of felt like having

 How does Facebook news use lead to actions in South Korea", " Mainstream media in South Korea is known to be ideologically polarized (Kim and Hyun, 2017)", " Therefore, although people tend to select politically consonant information or politically like-minded discussion partners (Iyengar and Hahn, 2009; Stroud, 2008, 2010), they can engage in political talks with politically dissimilar others within their online networks (Heatherly et al_, 2017)", " Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1_ Facebook use for news will be positively associated with discussion network heterogeneity on Facebook", " In particular, given the tendency of ideological polarization on SNSs in South Korea (Kim and Hyun, 2017), Korean SNS users are likely to give heed to supportive information in order to explain and justify their partisan stance during online interactions", " Drawing on the insights gained from this discussion, this study proposes the following hypothesis:  H2_ Discussion network heterogeneity on Facebook will be positively related to political participation", " Based on previous studies that examined the communication mediation model in SNS contexts, this study proposes the following hypothesis:  H3_ Facebook discussion network heterogeneity will mediate the influence of Facebook news use on political participation", " Thus, this study proposes the following hypothesis:  H4_ The relationship between Facebook use for news and discussion network heterogeneity on Facebook will be moderated by users\u2019 political interest", " Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H5_ The relationship between Facebook use for news and discussion network heterogeneity on Facebook will be moderated by users\u2019 conflict avoidance  Finally, combined with discussions above, this study tests a moderated mediation model", " Therefore, this study proposes the last hypothesis:  H6_ The indirect relationship between Facebook use for news and political participation via discussion

that discussion network heterogeneity on Facebook will be positively connected with political participation", " This is consistent with H2_  H3 expected that Facebook discussion network heterogeneity

network heterogeneity on Facebook will be conditional on users\u2019 political interest and conflict avoidance", " Therefore, H6 was supported", "  In addition, contrary to augments that political disagreement on SNSs may produce political ambivalence (Kim and Hyun, 2017; Lu et al_, 2016), this study suggests that political discussions with those who have differing opinions on SNSs may reinforce users\u2019 preexisting opinions, thereby resulting in opinion polarizations among SNS users (Lee et al_, 2014)", " In general, politicians and political parties pay much attention to the needs of those who are actively involved in politics (Kim and Hyun, 2017)", " Among these is the characteristic of Facebook news (pro-attitudinal or counter-attitudinal) addressed in previous studies

the adaptive functions of self-monitoring such as expressive control and responsiveness to social cues (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000); others to its negative consequences such as the tendency of high

their actual self \u2014 as they deliberately act in accordance with it across social situations \u2014 and this greater awareness means that they are more likely to be negatively affected by

recording combined use of a wiki and the video recording of oral presentations to improve communication Extroversion skills using a quantitative approach", " So, we propose:  H1_ The more extrovert a student is, the greater his/her enjoyment in the combined use of video recordings and a wiki", " H2_ The more extrovert a student is, the less stress he/she suffers in the oral presentation", "  H3_ The more extrovert student is, the better his/her attitude toward the combined use of video recording and a wiki", " Thus, we propose:  H4_ The greater the perceived relative advantages, a) the better the student's attitude toward the combined use of video recording and a wiki and b) the greater his/her satisfaction with the activity", " As a consequence, we propose the following hypothesis:  H5_ The greater the student's perceived enjoyment during the activity, a) the better his/her attitude toward the combined use of video recording and a wiki and b) the greater his/her satisfaction with the activity", "  Previous research has shown that online video sharing increases the level of students' excitement, anxiety and stress when using Web 2_0 platforms such as Youtube, Skype, Facebook or Second Life because other people can see their performance (Huang, Hood, & Yoo, 2013; Yoo & Huang, 2011)", " Therefore, we propose:  H6_ The greater the perceived stress during the oral presentation, a) the worse the student's attitude toward the combined use of video recordings and a wiki and b) the lower his/her satisfaction with the activity  H7_ The greater the student's perceived enjoyment, the lower his/her perceived stress in the oral presentation  3_3_ Attitude, satisfaction and recommendation  Attitude toward behavior refers to the extent to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior in question (Taylor & Todd, 1995)", " So, we propose:  H8_ A positive attitude toward the combined use of video recording and a wiki will positively influence the students\u2019 satisfaction with it", " So, we propose:  H9_ Satisfaction with the activity will positively influence the students' recommendation of the course  Fig_ 1 shows the model to be tested", " In our model the composite reliability index for all constructs exceeds the minimum acceptable value of 0_7 (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011), confirming internal consistency", " Henseler et al_ (2015) have suggested an alternative approach to assess discriminant validity, based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix: the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of correlations", "  Hypotheses H1, H2 and H3 are related to the effect of extroversion on enjoyment, stress and attitude, respectively", " According to the results, H1 and H2 are supported because there is a positive and significant effect of extroversion on enjoyment and a negative and significant effect on stress", " However, extroversion has no significant influence on attitude, rejecting H3_ The results suggest that the relative advantages positively influence attitude toward video recording, but that they have no direct influence on satisfaction", " Thus, H4a is supported but H4b is not", " Positive effects of perceived enjoyment on attitude and satisfaction were proposed, but only the positive relationship between enjoyment and attitude is supported (H5a), while H5b is not supported", " Related to the relationship between stress and attitude (H6a) and stress and satisfaction (H6b), the findings show a non-significant relationship with attitude and a negative and direct effect on satisfaction", " So the results only support H6b_ Enjoyment was proposed as an inhibitor of stress", " The results show a negative and significant relationship between these two variables, supporting H7_ A positive relationship was proposed between attitude toward the combined use of video recording and a wiki and satisfaction with the activity", " The results support this proposal (H8)_ Finally, the results support H9, as a positive and significant effect of satisfaction on recommendation is found", " Our findings show that enjoyment is an antecedent of attitude but not of satisfaction, which confirms other studies that analyze the relationship between enjoyment, behavioral attitude and satisfaction on social media such as Facebook (Lee, Xiong, & Hu, 2012)", "  Alyousef, H_ S_, & Picard, M", "

selective interpretation indices of valenced narcissistic traits (Burton et al_,  2017) guided the formation of the following hypothesis (H1):  H1_ Instagram users who post selfies and groupies will be perceived by viewers (a) to be more narcissistic and (b) to have more negatively valenced narcissistic traits (selective interpretation indices of narcissistic traits) than those who post photos taken by others and neutral photos", "  2_2_ Theory of planned behavior and social media  After testing the hypothesis about the effects of selfies on perceived narcissism (H1), the next pressing question is: \u201cWhat are the effects of Instagram post sources\u2019 different photo types on Instagram peer viewers\u2019 attitude toward selfies and behavioral intention to post selfies", " Hence, the following hypothesis is set forth (H2):  H2_ Selfies and groupies posted on Instagram will have more positive effects on viewers\u2019 (a) attitude toward taking selfies and (b) intention to take/post selfies compared to photos taken by others and neutral photos posted on Instagram", "  2_3_ Similarity attraction theory and Narcissistic tolerance hypothesis  After testing the effects of selfies (H1 and H2), the next question is: \u201cWould certain individuals judge selfies more favorably, even if selfies tend to be associated with negatively valenced narcissistic traits", " People's NPI scores are positively correlated with selfpromotion actions (Hart, Adams, & Burton, 2016), such that selfreported NPI scores positively predict self-endorsement intention, which in turn predict the intention to inflate one's performance", " Furthermore, there is a positive relationship between grandiose narcissism and assertive self-presentation tactic-use (Hart, Adams, Burton, & Tortoriello, 2017)", " GE is not typically correlated with vulnerable narcissism, which pushes  people to assert their dominance and power over others (Vonk, Zeigler-Hill, Mayhew, & Mercer, 2013)", " This distinction is crucial because it may solve the discrepancy found in previous research (Adams, Hart, & Burton, 2015) in which the rater's narcissism correlated negatively with tolerance for narcissistic traits, disconfirming the narcissistic-tolerance hypothesis (Hart & Adams, 2014)", " These theoretical foundations and empirical evidence guided the formation of the following hypothesis (H3):  H3_ Narcissistic Instagram viewers with grandiose exhibitionism (vanity and exhibitionism) will show (a) more positive attitude toward taking selfies (b) greater intention to take/post selfies and (c) greater intention to follow the Instagram post source than non-narcissistic Instagram viewers", " Driven by the aforementioned theoretical rationales for similarity attraction (Byrne, 1969) and narcissistic-tolerance (Hart & Adams, 2014), and building upon the most recent empirical evidence (Burton et al_, 2017), the following hypothesis (H4) proposed the mediating effects of perceived similarity between the post source and the viewer:  H4_ Perceived similarity between the target Instagram post source and the viewer will mediate the effects of narcissistic personality match versus mismatch on viewers\u2019 (a) attitude toward taking selfies (b) intention to take/post selfies (c) intention to follow the Instagram post source and (d) selective interpretation of valenced narcissistic traits of the post source", "  As viewers base their judgment of the source on visual cues from the profile interface (Hong, Tandoc, Kim, Kim, & Wise, 2012), the experiment further tested the effects of the post source's popularity (quantitative index of the number of followers: high [popular] vs", " To assess the effects of posted photo types, the post source's popularity, and viewers' NfP on the dependent variables, the following hypotheses (H5 and H6) were proposed:  H5_ There will be main effects and interaction effects of (1) the target Instagram post source's photo types, (2) the post source's popularity, and (3) viewers' NfP on (a) perceived narcissism and (b) selective interpretation of valenced narcissistic traits of the post source", "  H6_ There will be

selfies and high popularity and building upon prior empirical  demonstration of the mediating role envy plays in SNSs, the following hypothesis (H7) was proposed:  H7_ Envy will mediate the causal

three doses", " The aim of this study was to systematically review intervention studies on HPV vaccination completion", "  Eligibility Criteria: Intervention studies with a comparison group that assessed HPV vaccination completion rate as the primary outcome variable in adolescents and adults younger than 26 years of age, and published in English from 2006 to 2016, were eligible for review", " Intervention strategies were DVD-based education on HPV and reminders that were delivered via either electronic or non-electronic methods", " Non-electronic reminders were  Conclusions: The rates of HPV vaccination completeness increased with the interventions", " However, the completeness rate of HPV vaccination remained unsatisfactory and lower than its initiation rate", "  Implications: Educational and reminder interventions for HPV vaccination could contribute to HPV vaccination completion", " Background  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection that can result in HPV-related diseases, including genital warts and cervical cancer (de Martel, Plummer, Vignat, & Franceschi, 2017)", " Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women (Small et al_, 2017) and HPV vaccination is recommended to prevent this cancer", " The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all countries encourage HPV vaccination (WHO, 2017)", " As of March 2017, 71 countries had introduced the HPV vaccine via their national immunization programs (WHO, 2017)", " Currently available HPV  * Corresponding author: Jennie C", "kr (H_S_ Kang), jennie", " The American Cancer Society and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine HPV vaccination to be initiated in children 11 or 12 years of age, although can be started at age 9, with catch-up vaccinations or boosters up to 26 years of age (Saslow et al_, 2016)", " HPV vaccination requires the administration of two or three doses depending on the age of the recipient: two doses for boys and girls ages 9-14 and three doses for those who initiate the vaccination series at 15 years of age or older (Meites, Kempe, & Markowitz, 2016; WHO, 2017)", "  While the coverage of HPV vaccination varies across countries (Hull et al_, 2017; LaMontagne et al_, 2017), the initiation rate of vaccination for HPV in the United States is lower than for other vaccinations (e_g_, the meningococcal vaccine) because of (1) the voluntary aspect of HPV vaccination (Zimmerman et al_, 2017), (2) the stigma of sexually transmitted infections (Loke, Chan, & Wong, 2017), and (3) the fear of possible vaccine side effects (Thompson, Rosen, Vamos, Kadono, &8 H_S_ Kang et al_ / Journal of Pediatric Nursing 39 (2018) 7-14  Daley, 2017; Widman et al_, 2016)", " Furthermore, the completion rates for the 3-dose series of the HPV vaccine continue to be lower than the rates of initiation (Rahman, Hirth, & Berenson, 2017)", " HPV vaccination coverage in adolescent girls differs across countries ranging from 10% in Poland to >70% in Mexico, Uganda, and Australia (Hull et al_, 2017; Owsianka & Ganczak, 2015)", " The completion rates of HPV vaccination in adolescents from Canada range from 39_3% in the Northwest Territories (2013/2014) to 89_2% in Newfoundland and Labrador (2014/2015) (Shapiro, Guichon, & Kelaher, 2017)", " The national HPV vaccination rate for Australian females turning 15 years of age in 2014 was 81_5% for one dose and 71_4% for 3-dose completion (Hull et al_, 2017)", " The differences between doses 1 and 3 of HPV vaccination in Argentina was about 35% in 2013 (Patel et al_, 2016)", " Among US girls aged 13 to 17 years, while the HPV vaccination rate in 2016 was 65_1% for at least one dose and 49_5% for 3-dose completion, the coverage of more than one dose of Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine) and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine dose was 88_0%, and 82_2% respectively, and three doses of Hepatitis B vaccine completion was over 90% during 2015-2016 (Walker et al_, 2017)", "  Studies have explored the reasons why individuals did not complete the second and third doses of HPV vaccination", " The completion rate of HPV vaccination was higher when the cost was supported by healthcare insurance, when parents had more knowledge and positive attitudes (Dorell, Yankey, Santibanez, & Markowitz, 2011; Navarro-Illana, Navarro-Illana, Vila-Candel, & Diez-Domingo, 2017), when patients were reminded about the dosing schedule (Francis et al_, 2017), and when school-based vaccination programs were offered (Ladner, Besson, Rodrigues, Audureau, & Saba, 2014; Owsianka & Ganczak, 2015; Paul & Fabio, 2014; Smith et al_, 2011)", " Furthermore, the rate of HPV vaccination completion was higher with a provider's high-quality recommendations by endorsing the HPV vaccine, recommending same-day vaccination, and emphasizing cancer prevention (Gilkey et al_, 2016; Krantz, Ollberding, Beck, & Carol Burkhardt, 2017) rather than recommending it inconsistently, behind schedule, or without urgency (Gilkey, Malo, Shah, Hall, & Brewer, 2015)", " These studies included (a) text message reminders about the first dose of HPV vaccination for children ages 11-16 years (Rand, Vincelli, Goldstein, Blumkin, & Szilagyi, 2017), (b) provider-focused interventions, such as electronic medical record (EMR) prompts or provider training (Brewer et al_, 2017; Soon, Sung, Cruz, Chen, & Hiraoka, 2017; Szilagyi et al_, 2015), and (c) the provision of vaccines at school (Rehn et al_, 2016)", " Other studies explored the barriers to HPV vaccination (Holman et al_, 2014) and the factors influencing the completion of HPV vaccinations, as well as Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Varicella (Gallagher et al_, 2016)", " A systematic review of educational interventions focused on HPV vaccination acceptance, but did not present the actual vaccination rate (Fu, Bonhomme, Cooper, Joseph, & Zimet, 2014)", " A systematic review of 14 studies of practice- and community-based interventions to  increase HPV vaccination focused only on males and females 18 years of age (Niccolai & Hansen, 2015)", "  An initiation of HPV vaccination is important, yet its timely completion is also critical for maximum effect", " Low rates of HPV vaccination in women remain a significant health concern", " In particular, improving HPV vaccine coverage has the potential to reduce health disparities by protecting against HPV infection that leads to cervical cancer in individuals who are underserved and underprivileged", " This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of interventions implemented after the first dose of HPV vaccination on the rate of HPV vaccine completion in

reminders and no reminders (17_2% and 18_9%, respectively; p = 0_881) in the study with women aged 19-26 and conducted in 10 reproductive health centers (Patel et al_, 2014)", " After three months of sending letters by mail, HPV vaccine completeness was assessed, and reminder letters were again sent to the participants who had not received the vaccination", " In the study by Chao et al_ (2015), a customized reminder letter from the participants\u2019 primary care physician included the date of the first dose of the HPV vaccination, an encouraging message to complete the series, a telephone number to contact, and information about the HPV4 vaccine", " In the study by Patel et al_ (2014), reminder messages sent to the participants were as follows: \u201cReminder: schedule your next HPV vaccine", "\u201d With regard to health education, the DVD, called \u201c1-2-3 Pap,\u201d contained 10 broad messages related to HPV and HPV vaccines, including the benefits of vaccination, vaccine schedule, and means of overcoming obstacles to vaccination (Vanderpool et al_, 2013)", "  Discussion  This systematic review examined the effects of reminders for completeness of the HPV vaccine after the first dose in RCTs", " Of the five reviewed studies, three reported increased HPV vaccine completeness after intervention", " However, intervention modalities, such as the number of reminder methods used, the frequency and timing of reminder messages sent, and the follow-up time period assessed for HPV vaccine completeness varied across the studies", " We also assessed the overall quality of evidence (reminder messages with educational content to improve HPV completion) to be of moderate quality", "  Our review focused on the effects of interventions on timely HPV vaccination completeness", " Our findings are in line with other studies that found reminder interventions resulting in increased rates of HPV immunization completeness", " Similar to the current review, in nonrandomized studies conducted in academic or private pediatric clinics, interventions using reminders, such as text messages and automated phone reminders targeting the parents (Cassidy, Braxter, Charron-Prochownik, & Schlenk, 2014; Kharbanda et al_, 2011) and directly targeting adolescent girls (Matheson, Derouin, Gagliano, Thompson, & Blood-Siegfried, 2014), were effective in increasing the uptake of subsequent doses of the HPV vaccine", " In addition, a systematic review of HPV vaccination initiation and completeness reported that interventions utilizing communication technologies may increase vaccination coverage (Francis et al_, 2017)", " Therefore, the results of this study support the evidence that reminder interventions can be effective for timely HPV vaccine completion, but the impact of such interventions is limited as indicated by low completion rates", " Chao et al_ (2015) also found that delivering the reminders to parents of the adolescents aged 9 to 11 years was effective to complete the HPV vaccination", " These results imply that parents are an influential factor in HPV completeness", "  It has been reported that mothers and clinicians are the most influential persons for HPV vaccine completeness in adolescents (Gallagher et al_, 2016; Valentino & Poronsky, 2016)", " In a literature review on the barriers to HPV vaccine completeness among adolescents in the United States, parents consistently cited the recommendation of healthcare professionals as one of the most important factors in their decision to vaccinate their children (Holman et al_, 2014)", " Previous studies focusing on provider prompts showed that they were effective in improving HPV vaccine completion rates in adolescents (Szilagyi et al_, 2015)", " Furthermore, most studies related to12 H_S_ Kang et al_ / Journal of Pediatric Nursing 39 (2018) 7-14  HPV vaccination, including those in our review, depended on the mothers' support", " In addition, a study that reviewed literature on children and the HPV vaccine reported that research underrepresented the fathers (Walhart, 2012)", " Therefore, both healthcare professionals and the fathers of adolescents should be encouraged to be actively involved in promoting HPV vaccination to adolescents", "  The primary outcome of this review was the HPV vaccination completion rate based on objective data from EMR or health records", " In one study, the authors suggested that more women could have completed HPV vaccination if the time frame was longer (Patel et al_, 2014)", " When comparing HPV vaccination completion rates across studies, we have to keep in mind that the duration of completion will vary according to the time point of checking for completion", "  The interventions were provided based on the assumption that reminding individuals of the date of the next vaccination would lead to an increase in the rate of HPV vaccine completeness", " However, in our review, the overall completion rates were low, revealing a large gap in HPV vaccine series completion", " Given that school-based vaccination is effective for schoolaged adolescents (Daley et al_, 2014; Paul & Fabio, 2014; Stubbs et al_, 2014), providing an option for students to be vaccinated at school would be beneficial_ To overcome the low rates of HPV completion, interventions should address other factors that may influence HPV completion, including those at the level of provider and the health care system (Chao et al_, 2015)", " Given the low completion rates for HPV vaccination and the strong influence of healthcare professionals\u2019 recommendation (Holman et al_, 2014; Valentino & Poronsky, 2016), healthcare providers should emphasize the importance of timely HPV vaccine completion for adolescents when they receive their first doses", "  Furthermore, policy makers should make an effort to disseminate information on the importance of HPV completion using mass media and communication technology to create a supportive culture", " Future studies should explore strategies to reduce the drop-out rate and to improve the rates of timely HPV vaccine completion at the provider and the health care system levels", " In this review, intervention studies focused on HPV vaccine completeness, which requires three doses", " First, there were a limited number of randomized controlled studies assessing the completeness of HPV vaccination", " The timing of checking the primary outcome of HPV completeness was inconsistent, although the trends were similar", "  Conclusion  A comprehensive systematic review of the literature found few studies on intervention for HPV vaccine completeness", " This review found evidence that interventions, such as reminders, contributed to the promotion of HPV vaccination completion", " However, the overall completeness rates of HPV vaccination remained low", " There is clearly a need for more high-quality studies to identify strategies that can maximize the rate of timely HPV vaccine completion", " This review shows that establishing a reminder system and actively reaching out to all target populations that are recommended to receive the HPV vaccine, including

Law, Gu, & Chen, 2011)", " Mass media-delivered information can reach larger consumer audiences, while personally delivered information can facilitate two-way communication (Herr, Kardes, & Kim, 1991)", " To a greater extent, peer consumers can serve as opinion leaders or gatekeepers in social media environments (Paek, Hove, Jeong, & Kim, 2011) by not only spreading positive electronic word-of-mouth (eWoM) or sharing brand-related news and updates as a brand fan, but also posting negative reviews as a critical consumer (won, Kim, Sung, & Yoo, 2014)", "  Experiment 1 tested \u2014within the context of Facebook-the effects of different sources (a celebrity [self] versus an ordinary user [other]) of celebrity brand-related UGC embedded in the profiles and Timeline updates

higher persuasive power of otherendorsement than self-endorsement", " Based on this theoretical reasoning, the following hypothesis (H1) was proposed:  H1_ Brand-related UGC posted by an ordinary peer Facebook user (other-endorsement) will have more positive effects on consumers' perception of the celebrity endorser's (a) trustworthiness and (b) goodwill than brand-related UGC posted by the celebrity (selfendorsement) on his/her own Facebook page", " To address this gap, Experiment 1 attempted to examine the main effect of different sources of brand-related UGC in SNA on consumers\u2019 perception of PSI with a celebrity endorser (H2) and the mediating effect of social identification with the celebrity in accounting for the relationship between the type of the source (celebrity versus peer consumer) and PSI (H3)_  The first possibility with respect to H2 is that consumers may experience closer PSI with a celebrity endorser when exposed to brand-related UGC and SGC presented on the celebrity's own Facebook profile page than when exposed to brand-related UGC and SGC presented on an ordinary peer Facebook user's page", "  The second possibility with respect to H2 is the opposite pattern: consumers may experience closer PSI with the celebrity endorser when brand endorsements are presented on an ordinary peer user's Facebook page", " Acknowledging these two contradictory possibilities, the following two-tailed hypothesis was proposed:  66  H2_ Self (celebrity)-generated content versus other (ordinary peer Facebook user)-generated content regarding celebrity brands will have differential effects on consumers' perceived closeness of PSI with the celebrity endorser in SNA", " To test this mediating mechanism (Fig_ 3), the following hypothesis was proposed:  H3_ Social identification with the celebrity will mediate the effect of the endorser type (celebrity versus peer Facebook user) on perceived closeness of PSI with the celebrity", " The dependent variables included consumers\u2019 celebrity credibility perception (H1) and PSI with the celebrity endorser (H2)_ The mediating variable was social identification with the celebrity (H3)_

the internet and social technology can provide older adults with benefits such as high-level social support, more successful relationships, and greater life satisfaction among other things (Heo et al,

affects knowledge-sharing behavior (Hau and Kang, 2016)", " Furthermore, a shared vision is one of the constructs of social capital (Hau and Kang, 2016)", " Hau and Kang\u2019s study confirmed the positive relationship between shared goals and knowledge-sharing behavior, and this has been corroborated by Chang and Chuang (2011) and Fefebvre et al (2016), who found that the shared vision and language of community members affects their knowledge-sharing intention", " Thus, a third hypothesis was proposed:  H3_ Seniors\u2019 shared vision with other members of an SNS may positively affect their knowledge-sharing behaviors", " We thus proposed the following hypothesis:  H4_ Seniors\u2019 sense of community identification may positively affect their knowledge-sharing behaviors on an SNS", "Moreover, Hau and Kang (2016) found that social ties positively affect knowledge-sharing behavior", " Consequently, the following hypothesis was proposed:  H5_ Seniors\u2019 mutual social interactions and connections may positively affect their knowledge-sharing behaviors on an SNS", " He also indicated that a sense of meaning in life can be obtained through learning, working, and participating in activities, and gaining achievement and recognition from these processes", " Therefore, we proposed that participating in knowledge-sharing communities and engaging in knowledge-sharing activities may positively affect seniors\u2019 sense of meaning in life, yielding our sixth hypothesis:  H6_ Seniors\u2019 knowledge-sharing behaviors on an SNS have a positive effect on their sense of meaning in life", " In other words, H3-H5, which were related to social capital, were supported", " However, H1 and H2, which were related to individual motivations, were not supported", " He likes to share his own creative writing online", "  The finding of the insignificant influence of seniors\u2019 expected relationships within an SNS on their knowledge-sharing

E", " 2012_ Discourse of Twitter and Social Media: How We Use Language to Create Affiliation on the Web", "  Arguments about the benefits and utility of digital technology in universities present a familiar motif (Facer, 2011; Selwyn, 2016), and the potential for the use of social media in higher education (HE) in Australasia, as explored in this paper, treads some old ground in this respect", " AJET mi ASCILITE  Indeed in the intervening 10 years, the use of social media has rapidly permeated the HE sector globally (Johnson et al_, 2016; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010) and there is evidence that institutional approaches aside, students are making use of social media in their learning (Smith, 2017)", " While many would argue that it is no longer really a matter of whether to adopt social media in HE, but rather how best to do so, this situation still leads many institutions to adopt a cautious position, thus creating a need to explore the risks and the opportunities presented by social media for teaching and learning (Au, Lam, & Chan, 2015; Universities and Colleges Information Systems Association [UCISA], 2015)", "  Methodology  Our approach in this paper was driven by our shared research interests in social media in HE_ What began as a number of corridor discussions around the pros and cons of using social media in HE culminated in a symposium for an Australasian educational technology conference, which provided an opportunity to take the pulse of specialists in the field on this very subject", " In essence, the structure involved five researchers taking on various roles, including debate moderator, to ensure that the discussion remained focused and that there was enough opportunity for audience participation, and two panel members on each side defending a research-based stance for either the affirmative (that social media use in HE for teaching and learning was a good thing) or the negative (that the use of social media for teaching and learning in HE was inherently bad)", " Our aim was to access the breadth of opinion triggered by the debate in order to address our key question with regards to the use of social media in HE in Australasia \u2014 Where are we now", " For this reason, we have also chosen to weave the literature review through the Debating the use of social media in HE \u2014 Findings section in this paper, rather than presenting it separately, for the aim was to prompt the audience to participate and contribute to a discussion reflective of multiple perspectives and reflect on these perspectives in an integrated manner", "  \u201cThe Great Debate: Social Media Use in HE\u201d (Willems, Adachi, McCluskey, et al_, 2016) was conducted with the participation of an international audience on 28 November 2016 at the annual conference of the Australasian Society of Computing in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE) at the Adelaide Convention Centre", "  The participants in this study were firstly self-selecting, and secondly, they were participating in a conference about educational technology in HE, both of which shaped the data collected to an important extent", " This specific cohort was therefore likely to be relatively positive and excited about the potential of social media in HE_ Regardless of these limitations, it is still valuable to analyse the data in terms of the key themes and concerns that were raised in this context, as these participants can be seen as representative of those who drive innovation as it relates to social media use in HE in Australasia", "; social media in HE; institutional lag; staff professional development; pedagogy; social media policy; public versus private realms; formal learning and training of students versus personal and/or informal learning; digital natives; bullying/inappropriateness; personal learning environment vs learning management system (LMS); student empowerment; digital literacy; and personal experiences teaching with social media", "  Debating the use of social media in HE \u2014- Findings  In this section, we present the key ideas that emerged from the analysis of the qualitative participation in the debate: verbally from the audience as captured by the Periscope feed, and in text and images captured from the Twitter feed, interwoven with some of the literature presented as part of the debate itself (Clarke & Braun, 2013b)", " The resulting analysis represents the current perspectives of academics and educational technology specialists working in HE, who are mostly located in Australasia", "  The overarching argument in favour of the use of social media in HE, or at least in favour of considering its potential benefits for student learning, lies in the recognition that social media are part of everyday social life for most students (Cowling, 2017)", " Ignoring these facts could effectively create an artificial boundary between HE institutions and the society of which they are a part", " Thus, the arguments in favour of social media use in HE in this section all flow from this fundamental umbrella argument and are from both student and staff perspectives", " This raises a series of questions: How do we ensure the university retains  139Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2018, 34(5)", " How do we ensure learning keeps up with offerings from the private sector", " How do we connect with students and each other in increasingly complex environments", " How do we maintain control of commercially based technologies", " How do we protect ourselves from litigation", " How do we protect our students from breaches of privacy", " How do we manage new technologies when we cannot anticipate their consequences", " Here, the politics and economics of mass education are clearly evident: increasing competition across the sector, growing levels of participation across the social strata, complex regulation, and measurement processes that track retention rates whilst simultaneously measuring standards", "  Institutional lag  HE institutions have been, at best, slow and fairly pedestrian in their adoption of digital media", "  Staff professional development  During the debate, the importance of staff professional development in and around the use of social media in HE was raised", " For, as Selwyn (2014) has repeatedly pointed out, whilst there is often a strong perception that technology is a quick fix for issues pertaining to HE, the quick fix generally results in a host of unexpected problems arising from the introduction of the new technology itself", " Social media is here; it is being used for teaching and learning in HE \u2014 whether we like it or not \u2014 and so the real concern is how to best manage this", "  Towards a research agenda  Given the context and the audience, the debate was always going to yield potentially valuable insights into the use of social media in HE and, as we have seen, this turned out to be the case with themes emerging that extended beyond teaching and learning questions per se and into, for example, questions about institutional policies on the use of social media in HE and related institutional lag", " Regardless, there is clearly a perception within the industry that HE policies are not abreast of current student behaviours, and of teaching and learning practices", "  While there still appears to be a lack of adequate or appropriate social media policies in the Australian HE context, particularly as they relate to learning and teaching, there are some examples of social media policies in the United States HE context", " In the Australian HE context, the Office for Learning and Teaching (http://www", "  Conclusion  Like it or not, social media are part of the global landscape, including HE_ This paper has captured the debate of the pros and cons, reinforced by the tricky problems experienced by those working in academia", " It would therefore be worthwhile to compare these data with broader perspectives gathered across the HE sector", " This could for example include developing the Vygotskyan theoretical framework (Churcher, Downs, & Tewksbury, 2014) in more depth and then applying it to specific case studies to ascertain whether either the potential being promoted on the one hand, or the cautious attitudes towards social media use in HE on the other, are actually warranted and to what extent", " The value and scope of this particular research project has been an opportunity to map out and analyse the key themes and concerns as perceived by a cohort that can be seen as being at the cutting edge of technological innovation in learning and teaching in HE in the specific context of Australasia", " How communities of inquiry drive teaching and learning in the

Kiousis, & Wahl-Jorgensen, 2003; Stoycheff, 2016; Yun & Park, 2011), few have delved into the specific features of SNSs that may make them more or less similar to face-to-face interactions", " Meta-analyses and critical syntheses have found limited support for the major theoretical tenets as well as Noelle-Neumann\u2019s (1974, 1993) assertion of powerful effects ranging from the individual\u2019s willingness to speak out to the broader scope of shifting public opinions, voting behavior, and resultant political change (e_g_, Glynn, Hayes, & Shanahan, 1997; Glynn & Huge, 2014; Scheufele & Moy, 2000; Shanahan, Glynn, & Hayes, 2007)", " Thus, we hypothesize that a greater trait fear of isolation will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H1)_  The SoS theory noted, however, that some individuals will always be willing to express their opinion", " We expect that having stronger attitudes regarding police discrimination will be associated with less willingness to self-censor (H2)_  Another primary tenet of SoS is that individuals speak out based on their assessment of the opinion climate and whether their opinion aligns with the majority (Noelle-Neumann, 1974, 1993)", " In two meta-analyses, Glynn and colleagues found weak but consistent support for the idea that people are more willing to speak out when they believe others share their views (Glynn et al_, 1997; Glynn & Huge, 2014)", " Thus, we expect that perceptions of current opinion congruency will be associated with opinion expression such that those who believe their opinion aligns with U_S_ public opinion will be less likely to selfcensor (H3)_SPIRAL OF SILENCE ON SNSS 537  SoS also specifies that individuals may be more willing to speak out if they feel the tide is turning in their favor (Noelle-Neumann, 1974, 1993)", " As such, we hypothesize that perceptions of future opinion congruency will be associated with opinion expression such that those who believe their opinion will align with anticipated public opinion in the future will be less likely to self-censor (H4)_  SPIRAL OF SILENCE AND SELF-CENSORING IN ONLINE CONTEXTS  With the popularization of online interaction, scholars began to consider how the predictions of the SoS may hold up on the Internet", " Indeed, some early studies found that individuals were more likely to express opinions in chat rooms and online forums compared to face-to-face settings (Cortese & Seo, 2012; Ho & McLeod, 2008)", " Thus, in addition to our hypothesis based on trait fear of isolation (see H1), we anticipate that higher context-specific fear of isolation (fear of voicing opinions about police discrimination on Facebook) will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H5)_  The context and content of Facebook is governed by the decisions of users and algorithms (Pariser, 2011); as such, users may perceive differing opinion climates (Schulz & Roessler, 2012)", " Thus, we hypothesize that those who believe their opinion is congruent with the majority of their Facebook network will be less likely to self-censor (H6)_  The SoS also accounts for perceptions of future change in the opinion climate", " Thus, we expect that perceptions of future opinion congruency will be associated with opinion expression such that those who believe their opinion will align with the majority of their Facebook network in the future will be less likely to selfcensor (H7)_  Affordances of SNSs  It is important to examine SNSs as a specific context for the SoS", " Although previous studies have attempted to manipulate these affordances (e_g_, anonymity; Ho & McLeod, 2008; Yun & Park, 2011) or attribute their findings to them (e_g_, social presence; Ho & McLeod, 2008; Kim, Kim, & Oh, 2014; McDevitt et al_, 2003; R6ssler & Schulz, 2014), researchers generally do not directly assess how users perceive them", " Thus, users who perceive high levels of network association may be less willing to express their opinions about a controversial issue given the ability for both strong and weak ties, as well as those who agree and disagree, to engage with a posted opinion (H8)_  Network association allows others to view and interact on SNSs, which likely leads to a certain degree of social presence, or feelings that others are there sharing the same space (Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976)", " Several scholars have argued that individuals will be more likely to express opinions online compared to faceto-face because of diminished social presence (e_g_, Ho & McLeod, 2008; Jeffres et al, 1999; Kim et al_, 2014; Metzger, 2009), although limited research has actually tested this assumption and measured users\u2019 perceptions", " Following these findings, we expect that higher levels of social presence will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H9)_  One of the most commonly studied affordances in CMC research is anonymity", " Given that perceptions of anonymity have been associated with more open expression in many online contexts (Suler, 2004), we still expect that lower perceptions of anonymity will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H10)_  A final affordance of CMC 1s persistence (Fox & McEwan, 2017; Treem & Leonardi, 2013)", " Thus, we expect that higher perceptions of persistence will be associated with a greater willingness to self-censor (H11)_  METHOD  Sample and Procedure  Study methods were approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Review Board in February 2016, and data

congruent (1) or incongruent (\u20141) with the current perceived public opinion", " Following Ho and McLeod, the attitude measure and the future perceived climate were recoded (\u20141 = not

Social Media: Opportunities, Challenges, and Guidelines for  Conducting Experimental Research Camille Grange  Information Technology Department, HEC Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada  ABSTRACT  Human-computer interaction research on online social media has mainly focused on the use of single platforms such as Twitter and Facebook", "ca \u00a9 Information Technology Department, HEC Montr\u00e9al, Canada", "  The hybrid contexts that result from the generative materiality of social media are pervasive, and both HCI practitioners and researchers would benefit from a better understanding of their implications for users (Yoo, 2013; Zittrain, 2006)", " Yet although the advantages, the challenges, and the best practices associated with traditional experiments investigating human-computer interactions (HCI) are well documented (Hornbek, 2006; Jarvenpaa, Dickson, & DeSanctis, 1985; Oulasvirta, 2009; Perdue & Summers, 1986; Shadish et al_, 2002), the literature is more silent on the experimental study of HCI phenomena that pass over systems\u2019 boundaries and involve users who are part of a social network", " Social embeddedness implies that users, whose interactions with technologies are the focus of HCI researchers\u2019 observation and theories, are part of one or several (digital) social networks (Kane et al_, 2014; Oestreicher-Singer & Zalmanson, 2013)", " Accordingly, social heterogeneity demands that researchers account for variance in users\u2019 social capital_ This is a radical change compared to mainstream HCI studies, in which subjects tend to act in and be exposed to environments that are informationally equivalent (Siau, 2004)", " While no single methodology can afford high marks on all validity criteria, there are sensible reasons to expect that experiments conducted about in the context of hybrid SMNs could have particularly strong potential for the benefit of HCI research", " Two main reasons pertain to the value potential of experiments to study both system design and users\u2019 behaviors and/or perceptions, which are essential foci of attention in HCI research (Benbasat, 2010)", " As such, they can be considered as complements, rather than substitutes, to the more micro-level approaches that HCI studies favor", " This article contributes by helping researchers analyze HCI in the context of hybrid SMNs that leverage the capabilities of existing online social networks", " This is an exciting time for research on online social media, and we hope that the present study proves to be a useful step toward addressing interesting HCI issues such as those that involve the combinatorial arrangements resulting from connecting social media to other non-social platforms", " HCI research: Future

behaviors, including posting inappropriate photos (Mikami, Szwedo, Allen, Evans, & Hare,  Time |  Technology- Based SCFS  2010) and engaging in negative interactions with romantic partners (Feinstein et al_, 2013)", "  Within this analytic framework, Hypothesis 1 predicted that adolescents who reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at a given time point would engage in greater levels of SCFS at that same time point, controlling for their underlying trajectories of technology-based SCFS and overall frequency of technology use", " Hypothesis 2 predicted that adolescents reporting higher levels of depressive symptoms at a given time point would report greater levels of SCFS one year later, above and beyond what would be expected from their underlying trajectories of SCFS and overall frequencies of technology use", " This allowed for the examination of Hypothesis 1, that adolescents who reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at a given time point would report greater engagement in SCFS at that same time point, controlling for their underlying, longitudinal trajectories of technology-based SCFS and overall frequency of technology use", " In order to examine Hypothesis 2, that adolescents reporting higher levels of depressive symptoms at a given time point would report greater levels of SCFS one year later, above and beyond what would be expected from their underlying trajectories of SCFS and overall frequencies of technology use, the addition of lagged effects of depressive symptoms and frequency of technology use on technology-based SCFS was tested (see Fig_ 1)", " First, depressive symptoms at each time point were regressed on time-specific measures of SCFS (Hypothesis 1)", "  In order to test whether depressive symptoms at a given time point predict higher levels of SCFS one year later, controlling for adolescents\u2019 underlying trajectories of SCFS and the contemporaneous effects of depressive symptoms, lagged effects of depressive symptoms on technology-based SCFS were added to the model (Hypothesis 2)", " In other words, adolescents who reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at a given time point also reported higher levels of technology-based SCFS at that time point than would be expected solely based on their underlying trajectories of SCFS and technology use frequency (Hypothesis 1)", " Thus, boys, but not girls, who report higher levels of depressive symptoms at a given time point reported higher levels of SCFS one year later, over and above what would have been expected based on their

is in sight, and is being set as a target for year 2030_ Key to reaching the target is testing and diagnosing people living with HIV, which will enable them to access treatment, and in turn improve their quality of life and reduce new infections", " While, globally, the number of new HIV infections has systematically been decreasing since its peak in 1997, new infections among one of the most affected populations, gay men and other men who have sex with men, continue to expand in most countries [2]", " One of the greatest bottlenecks to reach the 2030 global goal is stigma and discrimination related to HIV and AIDS and specific populations that carry a disproportional burden of the epidemic", " Similar to findings in studies using web search data to track diseases such as influenza [6] and dengue fever [7], in US state internet search rates for the term \u201cHIV\u201d on Google were strongly correlated with data on new cases of HIV [8]", " HIV risk-related tweets were compared to HIV prevalence rates at the state and county levels in the US [15]", " From more than 2 million geo-located tweets from the United States they found around 10,000 tweets that were relevant to HIV risk taking behaviour (i_e_, drug use and sex) during the approximately 6-month period of the study", " Using negative binomial regression, they found a significant positive relationship between the number of tweets pertaining to HIV risk behaviour and the official case reports", " While there exists some caveats and bias in the content likely to be communicated on social media and the indirect link between HIV transmission and the risk factors being tracked online (sex and drugs usage) [16], social media for disease surveillance offers a high potential opportunity\u2014in terms of speed, breadth and cost\u2014as a complementary approach to __ traditional surveillance systems", "  \u201cZero Discrimination campaign\u201d was launched in 2014 by the Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, in support of a new law that prohibits discrimination against people living with HIV_ The campaign was run throughout the time of the World Cup to reduce barriers for HIV testing and  $115  promote HIV prevention efforts, which also motivated the timing of this study", "  In this project, we have developed social media monitoring tools and methods to capture the Brazilian population\u2019s perceptions of HIV and AIDS, HIV prevention, and discrimination towards HIV and AIDS and key populations in order to support programmatic HIV prevention activities in Brazil\u2014including the UNAIDS\u2019 \u201cZero Discrimination Campaign\u201d", " The initial premise of this study is that there is a connection between (a) HIV information and related campaign on anti-discrimination, and (b) how people respond and reflect in social media, and (c) how they use related services (HIV testing and treatment) in health facilities across the cities involved in the campaign and the World Cup", "  2_ The more is Tweeted on HIV, the more people end up  testing for HIV_  These hypotheses translated into the following research objectives for the benefit of the Brazilian campaign:  1_ Monitoring how the anti-discrimination and prevention campaigns were accepted by the public in social-media messages, and test if such monitoring could be used (by The Brazilian Ministry of Health and UNAIDS) for adapting the campaigns in real-time", "  2_ Utilizing Twitter to infer HIV related indicators, by  comparing time series of aggregates of tweets with

the long-term success of a business through franchising fees and contract arrangements (Lafontaine 1992; Hsu and Jang 2009)", " In the franchising system, franchisees are considered agents because the principals (franchisors) do not have sufficient information regarding the capability of the agents (franchisees) (De Castro et al_ 2009; Koh et al_ 2009; Hsu et al_ 2010)", " Remote business operations are likely to entail risk because businesses are less informed with regard to the cultural, economic, and political conditions of the local markets (Hsu et al_ 2010; Lee et al_ 2015)", " Given these defensive management behaviors, we anticipated that older top managers are likely to prefer franchising because franchising reduces operational risk (Hsu et al_ 2010)", " Therefore, we hypothesize as follows:  H1 The average age of TMT members has a positive impact on franchising", " Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H2 The average tenure of TMT members has a positive impact on franchising", " Given the literature review and the risk-averse nature of franchising, a third hypothesis is presented as follows:  H3 The average formal education level of TMT members has a negative impact on franchising", " This research thus proposes the following hypothesis:  H4 TMT members\u2019 value of share ownership has a positive impact on franchising", " Given the role of stock options and the intrinsic properties of franchising, we hypothesize as follows:  HS TMT members\u2019 stock option value has a negative impact on franchising", " Therefore, the total number of observations was 324_' The profile of the restaurant companies is presented in Table 1_  4_2 Description of variables  The degree of franchising (DOF), the dependent variable in the study, was measured as the number of franchising stores divided by the total number of stores by following the approach of prior research (Roh 2002; Hsu and Jang 2009; Koh et al_ 2009; Sun and Lee 2013)", " The purpose of using DOI as a control variable was to capture the agency problem between restaurant franchisors and franchisees that are located in remote areas, as done by Hsu et al_ (2010)", " Finally, we used LSR as a control variable and measured it with a binary variable (0 = full-service restaurant and 1 = LSR) given the literature support from Hsu et al_ (2010)", " The null hypothesis of the modified Wald test for group-wise heteroskedasticity is as follows:  HO: oO; = 6; fori =1,", " The null hypothesis of the Wooldridge test for autocorrelation is that there is no autocorrelation in the

levels differ when exposed to two image-sharing social network sites (SNSs)\u2014Pinterest and Instagram", " For example, those who engage with SNSs use their profile photos to construct online identities (Hum et al_, 2011)", " Thus, the following hypothesis is advanced:  H1_ Individuals with higher self-monitoring will prefer Instagram to Pinterest, while low self-monitors will prefer Pinterest to Instagram", " Thus, the following hypotheses are advanced:  H2a_ After being primed by Instagram, users will exhibit higher self-monitoring than their dispositional self-monitoring", "  H2b_ After being primed by Pinterest, users will show lower selfmonitoring than their dispositional self-monitoring", "  If Pinterest and Instagram, two distinctive image-sharing SNSs, can influence the extent to which individuals\u2019 dispositional selfmonitoring (Hypothesis 2), users of these two SNSs would display different styles of information process and evaluation", "  H3a_ Individuals who use Pinterest will display a more positive attitude toward a brand and ad when the brand is advertised with a product-oriented rather than image-oriented advertisement", "  H3b_ Individuals who use Instagram will display a more positive attitude toward a brand and ad when the brand is advertised with an image-oriented rather than product-oriented advertisement", " Since the intensity of using Pinterest and Instagram is associated with preference of the SNSs, it was used as a dependent variable for H1_ At the end of the study, participants were informed that there would be a following study and asked whether they would like to participate in the study for additional research credit", "  4_ Results 4_1_ Hypothesis 1 testing  To examine the relationship between individuals\u2019

hypothesis is as follows:  H1: Differences exist between men and women regarding the relevance of specific gratifications of fitness app usage", " Therefore, we predict the following more specific hypothesis:  H2: Gratifications that are connected with a comparison of results are more relevant for men than for women", " Based on the gender differences in gratifications in general fitness app usage, we also assume that the usage and gratifications for specific functions of mHealth applications (e_g_, voice coach or sharing results) are gender-specific and we propose the final hypothesis:

basis of the above findings we predicted that:  H2_ Egos reporting incidents of online trouble will likely be female and younger in age", "  H3_ Alters exhibiting troublesome behaviour will likely be

hypotheses (H1 and H2) stating that increased identification of disagreement was associated with younger egos and egos with larger networks", " For alters, consistent with hypothesised predictions (H3, H4 and H6), increases in being identified as a troublesome connection were associated with alters that were in the younger or unknown age categories, in offline contact with the ego and/or relatively popular on the ego network", " The majority (73_4%) of the troublemakers identified were between the ages of 16 and 21 years of age, supporting H3_ Disagreeable alters ranged in network popularity, in terms of the respective ego networks, from O to 67_87%", " Interestingly, this was higher than the mean popularity of the nondisagreeable \u2018friends\u2019 which was 14_21% (SD = 15_40%), and thus lends support to H4_  The proportion of disagreeable nodes in larger networks was 26_4%, compared to approximately 10% of nodes in networks of medium and low sizes", " In line with H1, a z-score comparison indicated that higher networks harboured a significantly higher proportion of disagreeable nodes than both medium (z = 9_76, p < 0_05) and low sized networks (z = 12_31, p <

the results for gender are fully in line with H2, this hypothesis also postulated that younger egos would be more likely to240 S", " In contrast, H1 was not supported by the multi-level analyses since ego network size was not a significant indicator of online disagreement", " H3 was therefore only partially supported by the multi-level model", " Consistent with H4, alter network popularity was identified as a significant predictor of alter disagreement, with a 1% increase in alter network popularity signifying a 3% increase in the likelihood of the alter being disagreeable", " In all models, consistent with H6, increases in the rate of offline communication between ego and alter indicated that the alter was more likely to be identified as disagreeable", "  Importantly, H5 postulated that offline communication would act as a moderator for the relationship between online interactions and disagreements", " In support of H5, a significant negative interaction between offline communication and Facebook communication (8 = \u20140_25, SE = 0_04, p < 0_001) was found for the multi-level models, while Facebook communication was consistently nonsignificant (p > 0_05)", " First, the network size hypothesis (H1) was partially supported", " Second, consistent with the ego demographics hypothesis (H2), younger female egos were more likely to report troublesome network alters", " Further, partial support was found for alter demographics (H3 and H4) with popular, male alters being more likely to be identified as troublesome", " Thirdly, a significant interaction between Facebook communication and offline communication (H5) suggested that alters exhibiting low Facebook communication and frequent offline communication were statistically more likely to be troublesome on a network", " Finally, a combination of offline communication patterns and frequency of relationship types provided support for H6, with known offline contacts presenting a greater likelihood of disagreeable behaviour", "  The influence of ego network size (H1) rendered mixed results", "  In line with previous studies, female ego's in non-adult age groups tended to be more prone to report instances of online disagreement (H2)_ This would suggest that younger females might  experience more negative experiences online", "  As predicted, male alters were more likely to be identified as network troublemakers (H3)_ Whilst there is marginal support for this finding in previous reports of online behaviour (Annenburg Public Policy Center, 2010), research into offline behaviours has postulated that troublesome males often partake in more direct forms of disagreement, with females adopting more indirect and potentially less visible means (Wyckoff & Kirkpatrick, 2016)", "  Increased popularity was also found to play a significant role in determining whether an individual alter was reported as a troublemaker (H4)_ Complementing research which has suggested that troublemakers tend to be highly connected individuals with wellhoned social skills (Arsenio & Lemerise, 2001; Volk et al_, 2015), this indicates that online troublemakers have a greater degree of mutual connections in the ego's network", " The significant interaction between Facebook communication and_ offline communication supported this argument (H5)_ Alters who were known and in frequent offline contact with ego were more likely to be identified as troublesome on a network when communication on Facebook was low", ", Horn, A", "org/10_4135/9780857020055_n8_  Hox, J", " Teens, kindness

positively on users\u2019 intention to use F-commerce platforms", "  H4: Subjective norms impact positively on perceived usefulness for users of F-commerce platforms", "  H5: Subjective norms have a positive influence on social image for users of F-commerce platforms", " Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H6: Perceived usefulness impacts positively on intention to use for users of F-commerce platforms  3_4_ Effects of trust  In the last few decades, research carried out in the area of marketing has highlighted the importance of trust between the parts as an element that favors the continuity of the relationship, making it an aspect of great importance in the area of business (Morgan and Hunt, 1994)", " Suh and Han (2003), McKinley and Ruppel (2014) and Zhou (2015), among others, suggest that trust will improve the users\u2019 perceived usefulness and, thus, the intention to use (Hsu, 2014; Filieri, 2015)", "  Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:  H7:

network games (Hansen and Lee, 2013), Internet experience (Lopez and Sicilia, 2014) and even S-commerce (See-To and Ho, 2014), among others", " For this reason, we propose the following hypothesis:  H9: E-word-of-mouth impacts positively on the intention to use F-commerce platforms", " This takes into consideration performance/quality value, emotional value, value-for-money, and social value (Hsu

interactions between strangers in virtual reality (e_g_, Ha & James, 1998; Liu & Shrum, 2002; Yoo, Lee, & Park, 2010; Zhao & Lu, 2012), interaction on WeChat is made between people who have been

significant at P < 0_001, thus validating H1-1 and H1-2_ Additionally, consistent with the conceptualization of direct and indirect network externalities as two formative second-order constructs, the sub-constructs of network size (f = 0_532) and number of peers (f = 0_568) are positively related to direct network externalities, and the sub-constructs of compatibility (B = 0_557) and complementarity (f = 0_559) significantly influence indirect network externalities, at p < 0_001_  Direct network externalities significantly influence social value (B = 0_409, P < 0_001), but the path coefficients of direct network externalities to information value (f = \u20140_026, ns), emotional value (8 = 0_107, ns), and hedonic value (f = 0_027, ns) are not significant", " Therefore, H2-1

social value (f = 0_247), information value (6 = 0_311), emotional value ($8 = 0_461), and hedonic value (f = 0_364) are all considerably high and significant at p < 0_001, supporting H4-1, H42, H4-3

Zhao, Grasmuck, & Martin, 2008)", " The majority of the profile pictures are posed photos rather than candid photos (Hum et al_, 2011)", "  While the literature has an abundance of studies on the linkage between mass media exposure such as magazine images and negative body image (Bair et al_, 2012; Clay, Vignoles, & Dittmar, 2005; Grabe, Ward, & Hyde, 2008; Groesz, Levine, & Murnen, 2002),

that Instagram usage impinges upon young adults\u2019 body image satisfaction (H;)_ Indeed, exposure to photos in Instagram has an adverse impact on body image that leads to body dissatisfaction", "  One of our main contributions of this study lies in identifying the positive influence of self-schema on self-discrepancy (H2)_ To the best of our knowledge no study has investigated this influence", "  The positive influence of self-schema on self-discrepancy supported our assertion that the negative influence of Instagram usage on body satisfaction is mediated by self-schema and selfdiscrepancy

establish the second main theoretical contribution of this study in furtherance to the existing literature", "  In addition, results of this study show that the intensity of positive influence of Instagram usage on self-schema is dependent on self-esteem (H4), such that Instagram usage has a stronger positive influence on self-schema among those with low level selfesteem", " Moreover, our results showed that the mediated model holds among individuals with low level of self-esteem (Hs), indicating the moderating role of high level of self-esteem in mitigating the  negative effect of

user-based features in improving detection performance as measured by accuracy, as stated in H3a_  In the following table about precision, only the result of PRE(WTU) > PRE(WT) is non-significant,

Bournemouth University, Poole, UK  ABSTRACT ARTICLE HISTORY The social media landscape creates opportunities for higher edu- _\u2014Received 30 September 2016 cation institutions (HEIs) to amplify psychological engagement \u00abcepted 15 April 2017 with students and to increase influence impressions by following KEYWORDS student(s)-to-student(s) conversations and stories", "  Introduction  The higher education (HE) environment is experiencing a period of great change", " These changes have forced UK higher education institutions (HEls) to search for a unique definition of what they offer in order to differentiate themselves and attract students (Chapleo, 2007; Gai, Xu, & Pelton, 2016; Hemsley-Brown & Goonawardana, 2007)", " In doing so HEls will optimise marketing impacts through business decisions that are based on student-consumers\u2019 data (Gai et al_, 2016; He, Fang, & Du, 2015)", "  Tomlinson (2015) highlights that HEls put less emphasis on understanding how students form their relationships with HEls_ HEls are often forced to create their own digital footprint as well as to engage in practices similar to those in the tourism industry", " These include reviewing user-generated comments and content related to all aspects of the provision of HE experiential services (Scullion & Molesworth, 2016)", " This leaves us with the question of what aspects of HE experiences students talk about online, and what student-generated content could potentially be leveraged for effective HE branding", " Extensive studies on social media in the HE sector have been conducted (Ngai, Tao, & Moon, 2015) with a primary focus on exploring the pedagogical value of social media in facilitating learning and supporting teaching practices (Barn, 2016; Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2012; Neier & Zayer, 2015; Nel, 2015)", " Both studies found that content presented on HEls\u2019 websites and their efforts to engage with social media leveraging have positive and significant impact on students\u2019 choices of HEls_ However, no in-depth evidence into understanding how students engage with social media content has been provided", " Moreover, evidence of understanding how HEls can utilise student-generated social media data for HE marketing and branding purposes is limited", " Gai et al_ (2016) conducted netnographic analysis of online content published within a Chinese online forum dedicated to choosing international HEls_ However, to our knowledge no published study reports on experiences in listening and learning from Facebook student-generated social media data, as opposed to specialised in HE themes online forums as well as websites, blogs and microblogs developed for pedagogical purposes (Barn, 2016)", " The aim of this study, therefore, is to illustrate a netnographic analysis of a \u2018This is Where | study\u2019 (TIWIS) Facebook page that can develop HE marketers\u2019 interest and continue academic conversations on role of netnographic data in HE marketing and pedagogical practices", " Building on work by Calder, Malthouse, and Maslowska (2016), the research objective of this study is to explore actual student engagement (behaviour) with the studentgenerated HE experiences-related content", "  This paper begins with a brief review of the literature relating to HE marketing, social media marketing and student experiences", "  Theoretical background  HE has become one of the fastest-growing service sectors (Alwi and Kitchen, 2014)", " As discussed in the introductory section, recent changes in the HE context have forced UK HEls to reconsider their operational and strategic models, integrating market-driven business practices to remain competitive and to maintain economic viability (Scullion & Molesworth, 2016; Tomlinson, 2015)", " Hence, it should be argued that in the HE marketing context, content created by students is more likely to resonate with other students and result inJOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT &) 745  higher engagement levels", "  Despite social media being a vital part of current HE pedagogical practices, as argued by Gai et al_ (2016) and Scullion and Molesworth (2016), the HE context is slower in recognising the value of student-generated social media data and content for the HE marketing, branding and recruitment purposes", "  Gai et al_ (2016) conducted netnographic analysis of online content published within a Chinese online forum dedicated to choosing international HEls_ Although the online forum in Gai et al_ (2016) study is an independent forum aimed at students sharing their international HE experiences and helping others to make more informed decisions; such forums have a specific theme that drives students to create and consume reviews and comments", " It therefore limits authenticity and more dynamic understanding of students\u2019 experiences and engagement with HE products and services (Calder et al_, 2016)", " To meet the research aim of this study, we need to create a social media artefact that enables HE students to connect with each other and share experiences over time, and monitors the creation and consumption of HE brandrelated and experience-related content", " This has led to the emergence of the formally documented student-as-consumer approach, according to which students convey a consumer orientation in making choices about and experiencing HE services (Molesworth, Nixon, & Scullion, 2009; Bunce, Baird, & Jones, 2016; Khanna, Jacob, & Yadav, 2014; Hemsley-Brown & Oplatka, 2015)", " O\u2019SULLIVAN  providers of services \u2014 to students \u2014- the consumers of HE services and products (Tomlinson, 2015)", " Bunce et al_ (2016) report a lack of empirical evidence suggesting that students are in fact seeing themselves as consumers while already experiencing HE services and products but do argue that at the stage of choosing HEls students do act as consumers", " Internet technology and applications play an even greater role in accelerating the power and control students-as-consumers are experiencing when engaging with HE services and products (Ian & Ammari, 2016; Royo-Vela & Hunermund, 2016)", " Effectively, the intangible nature of HE services and products forces students to turn to the internet and social media sharing platforms for authentic insights into current student-as-consumer experiences", " Royo-Vela and HUnermund (2016) conducted qualitative in-depth study into understanding what online channels have significant impact on postgraduate students\u2019 choice of HEls_ They found that students do rely heavily on advertising, university ranking websites and previous experiences, mostly documented via social media sites", " However, it provided no deep understanding on how students engage with social media HE branded content", "  To date, characteristics of students as online consumers of HE experiences remain neglected or are assumed to be similar to online consumers of younger age groups", " First, there are students as online content consumers for pedagogical and/or personal HE experience purposes", " Second, there are students as online content contributors for pedagogical and/or personal HE experience purposes, and finally there are students as online content creators for pedagogical and personal HE experience purposes (Muntinga, Moorman, & Smit, 2011)", " It is, therefore, rational to explore in greater depth students as online consumers of HE experiences for personal purposes", " It is best to start with investigating students\u2019 engagement with social media content related to HE experiences and brands", " Figure 1 shows conceptualisation of student as online consumer engagement with student-generated Facebook content, related to HE experiences that will be explored in this study", "  Social media and its application in the HE context  Social media, defined as technological platforms and channels which enable communication and exchange of data virtually between individuals or groups of individuals anywhere anytime (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010; Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy, & Silvestre, 2011), are paramount to brands and businesses connecting and interacting with their consumers (Murdough, 2009)", " Another interesting topic on the current agenda of HE pedagogy and HE marketing scholars is the impact social media plays in students\u2019 engagement with HE with specific reference to the fear of missing out (FoMo) (Hetz, Dawson, & Cullen, 2015; Vorderer, Kromer, & Schneider, 2016)", " These studies conclude that while engaging with HE, students tend to consume social media content and communicate with their peers and networks beyond learning purposes, which overall results in distractions from the learning process", " However, an important fact to note from these FoMo studies is that students are active social media users who follow other students\u2019 HE experiences as well  Behavioural expressions towards HE related student-generated experiences (sentiment Facebook content, analysis of studentrelated to HE generated comments,  experiences content related to HE (manifestations, e_g_ experiences) likes, shares and opinion comments)  Student as online consumer engagement with student-generated Facebook content, related to HE experiences     Figure 1_ Conceptualisation of engagement with student-generated Facebook content", "  Despite numerous attempts to integrate social media in the delivery of HE, it has been already stated that its use for branding and marketing purposes is under explored by the HEls (Gai et al_, 2016)", " Although marketisation is not new to the HE context, HEI marketers need to accept that the modern brand communication landscape has changed significantly (Whelan & Wohlfeil, 2006) and adopt wider business practices of using social media to protect and expand the brand, monitor customer interactions, share and encourage positive brand, product or service engagement", " Student-generated HE-related conversations about experiencing HE cannot be detached from the social media environment that enables and influences the process, tone and outcomes of social media conversations (Gai et al_ 2016)", " Applying Calder et al_ (2016) conceptualisation of engagement construct, we have examined netnographic subjects (students communicating within an online community) and their interactions, with the purpose of extracting netnographic evidences of behavioural expressions and experiences of student-generated Facebook content, related to HE experiences", " TIWIS represents the UK HE experiences consociation with a common theme for users and audience", " TIWIS addressed this by creating a dedicated place for relevant \u2018social recommendations\u2019 on aspects of HE/ student life that is easily accessible and, importantly, socially shareable", " Hence, TIWIS represents a \u2018perfect\u2019 focal context for the netnographic inquiry set to explore students\u2019 engagement with student-created content related to HE experiences", " Royo-Vela and Hinermund (2016) found that Facebook and Google+ are main social media platforms to access trustworthy information regarding HE experiences", " The aim of the TIWIS set-up research phase was to understand what types of content would be particularly interesting for students experiencing HE in general, as well as students who study outside home country", "  Qualitative primary data was entered into NVivo 10, qualitative data analysis software, and analysed using thematic analysis focusing on themes with intention to explore social media content of interest among international students studying in the UK HEls_ Iterative process of coding and themes identification was applied to, first, identify initial themes emerging from primary data and, second, to compare primary data themes against secondary data themes and to corroborate the coded themes (Fereday & MuirCochrane, 2006)", " How is it to study", "  All focus groups and interviewed students agreed that once they have chosen an HEI and are in the UK, they seek more stories about experiences and opportunities which are posted and created by students like them", "  (2) Sentiment analysis - Facebook enables social dialogues and commentary using not only reaction and engagement-measuring tools (i_e_ likes, shares etc_) but also using written communication and emoji symbols which are capturing the essence of social media conversations as well as representing the richest data (Debatin, Lovejoy, Horn, & Hughes, 2009)", "  Students from BU and collaborating HEls involved in the creation of stories and posts report that involvement with TIWIS led to the enhanced learning of UK and HEI experiences in two ways", "  Second, it provided opportunities to engage and listen to student-generated stories and student-to-student conversations that indicate students\u2019 interests as well as illustrate students\u2019 engagement and experiences with HE_ Educator 2 highlighted:  Most of content that is of interest to international students studying in the UK universities does not concern teaching and learning", " This is because student-to-student conversations, as well as student-generated posts, directly communicate students-as-consumers\u2019 aspirations, experiences, feelings and emotions, meaning that by tapping into student-to-student conversations HE marketers can match the HEI brand\u2019s messages to the students\u2019 needs and desires", "JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT &) 755  Understanding nature of and engagement with the student-generated data: three-step analysis  Table 3 illustrates the main results of student-generated social media metrics with a particular emphasis on findings that have implications for the marketing of HE_  Table 3 illustrates that students engaged well with student-generated

experiences presented in Figure 1_  Sentiment analysis highlights that although students seek to consume content across the themes identified during the TIWIS set-up research process, reactions and commentaries to content generated by students\u2019 creators reveal truly important themes comprising international students\u2019 HE experiences", " Sentiment analysis overall demonstrates that students react positively to student-generated content and that HE experience is a complex system of various elements, which in the case of international student includes aspects of culture and social norms", " Most commentaries have not triggered further behavioural expressions of likes, so in this section of analysis we have not found evidence to demonstrate impact of HE-related experiences on behavioural expressions towards studentgenerated TIWIS content, related to HE experiences", " Network analysis extends further results of sentiment analysis showing that in the case of TIWIS, female students are more likely to provide insights into own experiences of HE, meaning in female students behavioural expressions trigger sharing their own HE-related experiences", "  Interpretation of three-step social media data analysis suggests a number of implications for HE marketing", " The most important implication for HE marketers to leverage student-generated social media data is maximising psychological engagement with HE-related experiences and hence increasing influence impressions", " However, in doing so HEls, following experiences of market-driven businesses, need to collaborate with student (brand) personas who can endorse their positive HE experiences in an authentic way and, therefore increase social impressions", " Hence, it is not surprising to find that most students looking for HEls or currently studying in HE are forming social media groups and networks with the purpose of discussing and sharing HE experiences", " In this study the TIWIS Facebook page unites prospective and current international students studying in UK HEls_  Mangold and Faulds (2009) and Hanna, Rohm, and Crittenden (2011) both proposed that social media should be considered as a hybrid element and included into a businesses\u2019 integrated marketing communications strategy due to containing the most influential but challenging to manage outcome of marketing communications \u2014 word-of-mouth", " Sentiment analysis results suggest that when choosing HEls, international students focus on the overall aspects of students\u2019 lives, where social and learning experiences are intertwined", " Despite the fact that TIWIS analysis does not allow us to conclude whether this is the case in the HE context, in particular with the effect on attitudes, consumption and post-consumption of HE services and products, TIWIS comments and conversations demonstrate that social media generates awareness as it acts as a bank of HE-related experiences and stories", " Moreover, the TIWIS case demonstrates that student as online consumer engagement with student-generated Facebook content, related to HE experiences, is a dynamic construct where behavioural expressions affect HE-related experiences, but not vice versa", " Hence, engagement with student-generated TIWIS Facebook page content can be conceptualised as per Figure 2_ This conceptualisation needs further evidence in empirical studies similar to this as well as further examination of relationships between such engagement construct and choices of HE students", " O\u2019SULLIVAN  Behavioural expressions towards student-generated HE related  TIWIS content,related experiences to HE experiences  Student as online consumer engagement with student-generated TIWIS content, related

discussed in the previous section, the most important implication for HE marketers to leverage student-generated social media data is maximising psychological engagement with HE-related experiences and hence increasing influence impressions", " Clearly, social listening needs to be embedded into social media marketing practices of HE_  Furthermore, the brand is an important element in marketing and it is perceived to be true in the context of HE_ Marketers often categorise social media as a branding channel", " However, the power of content creators needs to be left or shifted to students, whereas the role of HE marketers, educators and other stakeholders is in listening and engaging via students as brand personas, students who truly believe in a specific HEI brand but also are able to generate authentic stories and conversations with current and prospective students", " HE context presents challenging environment with ongoing debate around whether students should be considered consumers of HE services and products", " Despite the fact that pedagogical implications of the student-as-consumer approach are still to be examined, students do behave as consumers when choosing and even when experiencing HE beyond curriculum", " We argue that when marketing HE and HEls, learning from corporate brands and marketing communication practices is essential_ HE context, however, creates opportunities for innovative ways of leveraging social media data, publicly available and generated by consumers", " Engagements underpinned by emotional and authentic storytelling, tapping into the needs and desires of current and prospective students, ought to be main drivers behind HE marketing campaigns", "  Overall, although not directly proving the link between engagement with studentgenerated data and HE choices, the TIWIS case illustrates that student-generated data is an authentic source of data needed for the effective recruitment of international students", " Moreover, this study triggers further exploration into ethics of adapting market-driven social media marketing practices by HEls_ As Scullion and Molesworth (2016) argue, students may not see themselves as consumers and, hence, see HEls\u2019 practices of \u2018watching\u2019 students in their personal spaces as invasion of their privacy", " Her teaching covers courses on both undergraduate and

perspective of entertainment oriented technology and applied the TAM model by incorporating social influences and flow experience as belief-related constructs to predict the acceptance [27]", " Ha et al_ conducted research on wireless mobile broadband games and argued that both technological and psychological aspects are of importance for mobile game adoption [32], by extending TAM to include flow experience and attractiveness and measure the moderating effects of gender and age", " Consequently, we propose the following hypotheses:  (H1) Perceived ease of use (PEU) positively influences user's perceived usefulness (PU) of playing mobile social games", "  (H2) Perceived ease of use (PEU) positively influences user's attitude (ATT) on social based mobile games", "  (H3) Perceived usefulness

Attitude (ATT) positively influences user\u2019s intention (BI) to play mobile social games", " Moreover, in a study of the determinants of adoption of mobile games under mobile broadband wireless access environment, Ha et al_ argued that perceived enjoyment should be one of the characteristics of games and perceived enjoyment should be included when  analysing game systems [32]", " Since social network based mobile gaming is also a kind of hedonic systems, we made the following hypotheses:  (H6) Perceived enjoyment (PE) positively influences attitude (ATT) on mobile social gaming", "  (H7) Perceived enjoyment (PE) positively influences intention (FL) to play mobile social games", "  (H8) Perceived enjoyment (PE) positively perceived usefulness (PU) of playing mobile social gaming",

Rubio, Lucia Fernandez  Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain     ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT        Article history:  Received 1 April 2016  Accepted 16 September 2016 Available online 18 October 2016  Human Resource (HR) professionals are increasingly using Social Networking Websites (SNWs) for personnel recruitment and selection processes", " A recent survey among Spanish HR administrators showed that 69% use SNWs for recruitment and selection (LinkedIn, 77%, Twitter, 29%, Facebook, 24%), 79% believe that those applicants who are active users of SNWS are more employable, and 33% confirmed that they had rejected applicants on the basis of the information contained in SNWs (Infoempleo-Adecco, 2014)", "  HR administrators could use these networks in different ways", " Accordingly, we set the following hypothesis:  H1_ Participants will show more negative reactions to npDSNWs compared to pSNWs when they are used as selection tools", " It is hypothesized that:  H2_ Women will show more negative reactions to npSNWs, where the information contained is not aimed at searching for a job, than men; but not to pSNWS where the information contained is aimed at searching for a job", " It is hypothesized that:  H3_ The older the individual, the more negative the reaction to the npSNWs when used for selection assessment but not to the pSNWs", " Assuming that looking for a job is one of the most important reasons for joining pSNWs (Stopfer & Gosling, 2013) and that networking is one of the most effective activities in finding work (Van Hoye, Van Hooft, & Lievens, 2009), SNWs would be expected to be one of the most relevant tools in this endeavour", " It is hypothesized that:  H4, Participants actively looking for a job will have a more positive attitude to the use of SNWs in selection processes than those who are not actively seeking employment at this moment", " Perception of Face Validity was significantly higher than To test hypothesis 2, 3 and 4, a t-test was used comparing applithe other two subscales (d=0_82 with Predictive Validity, d=0_91 cants\u2019 reactions according to gender, age, and employment status", " Therefore, the results just partially support hypothesis 2_  With regard to age (see Table 4), there were significant differences but only for the reactions to the npSNWS", " Therefore, hypothesis 4 cannot be supported either", " The different reactions to pSNWs and npSNWs ought to lead HR professionals to initiate a critical analysis of the use of the latter in selection processes", " Aguado et al_ / Journal of Work and Organizational

aims to explore the following research question: How do YouTube users respond to online materials that can be described as explicitly inciting hatred", " Its usually those people that moan about others but are happy to scrounge benefits and freebies of others who work in Britain and pay taxes like the people she insults (Poster B)  Here, there is an allusion to Emma\u2019s racism as a direct consequence of her perceived low intelligence and low socio-economic status", " Here, this strategy to position Emma as a racist (i_e_ an out-group member) further seems to serve as a means of making sense of Emma\u2019s behaviour", " This, in turn, echoes previous work focussing social identity processes (e_g_ Blackwood, Hopkins, Reicher, 2012, 2013, 2015; Reicher, Haslam, & Rath, 2008; Tajfel & Turner, 1979; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987)", " (Poster H)  This comment displays categorical thinking through its use of distancing pronouns, such as \u201ctheir\u201d foreign oppressive laws, implying that laws were not voted for or made by us (i_e_ here, White people)", "  mou  Here, the contrast between negative terms, such as \u201cinvaders\u201d, \u201coppressive\u201d, \u201cgenocide\u201d, \u201cindigenous White\", and positive terms, such as \u201cadorable\u201d, \u201cstood up\u201d and \u201cbravery\u201d emphasises the distinction between the in-group and out-group (i_e_ perceived racial differences)", " Here, British nationals supporting immigration are categorised as out-group members by those opposing immigration which suggests that hostility expressed towards ostensible out-group members serves as a Strategy to create inter-group conflict and justify action against them", " There were also many posters who argued that immigration was an inevitable consequence of Britain's colonial history:  Hey lady - you don't like people from other countries or ethnic backgrounds in your country or calling them British or English - you guys started it", " Here, posters did not simply try to position themselves in relation to Emma - instead, this theme indicates the extent to which respondents attempt to go beyond taking a specific stance on racism", " HOW SHE WAS SAYING THIS IS MY BRITAIN", " (Poster M)  Here, the poster clearly rejects Emma's version of \u2018Britishness\u2019 and, particularly, the view that anyone can be considered \u2018purely\u2019 British - including the ultimate symbol of \u2018Britishness\u2019, namely the Royal Family (ETHNOS, 2005)", " Here, such references create a sense of social identity threat (Branscombe et al_, 1999; Reicher et al_, 2008; Verkuyten, 2013) amongst those supporting Emma whilst simultaneously invoking conflict with the perceived out-group (i_e_ foreigners)", " (Poster N)  Here, the British government is reproached for allowing \u201cthe flood of immigrants\u201d into Britain - the poster thus distances him/herself from the government's vision of Britain", " (Poster O)  Here, then, multiculturalism becomes the very essence of what it means to be British - which is in direct opposition to the views and behaviour depicted in the YouTube video", " Here, people who reject immigration are being reminded, that, although Britain\u2019s colonial history might appear glorious to some, British history is rooted in the (bleak) past of those living in the colonies which, in turn, here justifies immigration", " Here, this \u2018othering\u2019 strategy served not only as a means of Making sense of Emma but, paradoxically, also led to Meeting hatred with hatred, as expressed in Emma\u2019s dehumanisation", " Here, negative other-presentations was frequently linked to expressions of a sense of injustice or relative deprivation", " Here, responses to a certain, racially motivated hate incident on one specific SNS (i_e_ YouTube) were explored", ", & Norton, H_ L_ (2011)", "org/10_1037/h0047358  De Koster, W", " No guts, no glory:

of culture in HCI_ Additionally, the review identifies topics that are still unresolved or underexplored by the research community", " The study also attempts to increase cultural-awareness in the HCI community", "  2 Methodology  The methodology followed to identify the literature on culture in HCI and social networks was by searching for articles in well-known relevant academic journals and through keyword searches in Google Scholar", " By following the citations of the papers found from the above methodology, it was observed that the journal of computer-mediated communication had relevant studies on culture in HCI_ As a result, it was also chosen for inclusion for search of academic papers", "  Search keywords included \u201cCulture\u201d, \u201cHCT\u2019,

for instance, were examining social networks in general with only minor relevance to culture while some others were addressing culture in non-HCI systems", "  The taxonomy of the papers, as shown in Table 1, revealed that studies of culture in HCI and SNS can be divided into two broad categories, described in the following", "  Most of the studies found indicate that users from different cultural backgrounds do not share the same beliefs and perceptions towards an HCI system", " As technology is progressing rapidly it is essential to examine those culturalUniv Access Inf Soc (2016) 15:629-642

the visible and invisible cultural characteristics that influence users\u2019 perceptions towards the use of a system", "  3 Culture in HCI  Culture is a term for summarizing the way people think, feel or act in a society", " How someone is dressed, or their hair style also fall into this category", "  One of the areas that the research community focused on is the role of culture in HCI_ Many studies were conducted to evaluate HCI to understand how cultural values influence user interaction", " There are many studies that demonstrate the importance of culture in HCI_ It is also generally

positive for a harmful BRCA mutation are highly predisposed to developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) (i_e_, 40\u201487% risk for breast and 22\u201465% risk for ovarian for BRCA1 and 18\u201487% breast and 10\u201435% ovarian for BRCA2, Mavaddat et al_, 2013)", " Thus, the purpose of this study was to understand the ways in which BRCA-positive patients\u2014sometimes referred to as previvors\u2014experience uncertainty about HBOC_  While much research explores uncertainty in health and illness (e_g_, Brashers et al_, 2003; Middleton et al_, 2012; Mishel, 1988, 1990, Mishel et al_, 2005), little is known about how testing positive for the BRCA genetic mutation affects the experience of uncertainty (Baty et al_, 2006; Dagan and Gil, 2004; Dimillo et al_, 2013)", " Uncertainty exists when a situation or information is probabilistic, ambiguous, or complex (Brashers, 2001; Han et al_, 2011a, 2011b)", " Probability refers to the likelihood a future event or outcome (Han et al_, 2011a)", " Ambiguity signifies conflicting evidence, the evidence\u2019s strength, or lack of information (Han et al_, 2011a)", " Complexity refers to the many factors and interpretations of an event that make it difficult to understand (Han et al_, 2011b)", " As such, uncertainty management theory provides a useful framework for identifying and understanding BRCA-positive patients\u2019 experiences of uncertainty about HBOC_  1_2_ Women\u2019s health experiences about HBOC  Existing research investigating BRCA-positive patients\u2019 health experiences focuses primarily on genetic testing and medical decision-making", "  In addition, some studies investigate patients\u2019 experiences of uncertainty who have tested positive for BRCA, have a prevalent family history of HBOC, and/or have been diagnosed with HBOC (Baty et al_, 2006; Bylund et al_, 2012; Dagan and Gil, 2004; Fisher et al_, 2014; Hesse-Biber, 2014a, 2014b)", " Thus, the central aim of this study was to understand the ways in which BRCA-positive patients experience uncertainty about HBOC_ Using Brashers\u2019 uncertainty management theory as a theoretical framework, the following research question framed the present study: What sources of uncertainty do BRCApositive patients experience", " Although there are other hereditary cancer genes that may increase one\u2019s risk of HBOC, the science is relatively new", " How did you feel", "\u201d And although the biopsy results were negative for cancer, that health experience solidified Camille\u2019s belief about her uncertain future\u2014 \u201cHow many biopsies can you have [before they discover something cancerous]", " This research will hopefully help further research on uncertainty management and HBOC_  5_ Limitations  There are two main limitations of the present study", " First, it may be fruitful to explore the differences for women who are BRCAI-positive versus BRCA2-positive as these genetic mutations are associated with different lifetime risks for HBOC_ Second, given literature that discusses the desirability of genetic testing as well as ethical implications of genetic testing (e_g_, Hesse-Biber,

Disparities, University of Michigan  Abstract  One efficacious strategy to help prevent HIV is oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily regimen of antiretroviral treatment taken by HIV-negative individuals", " Despite the recognition of how primary partners in male couples\u2019 relationships shape HIV risk and CDC\u2019s PrEP guidelines, there is a paucity of data that examines HIV-negative male couples\u2019 attitudes toward PrEP use, and using PrEP with a sexual agreement", "Mitchell et al_ Page 2  Keywords  Male couples; Pre-exposure prophylaxis; Attitudes; Sexual agreements; Qualitative interviews; Dyadic data  1diosnue~= JOUINY }diosnuep JouINY }duosnuep JOUINY  1disoOSsnuey JOUINY  The advent of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) \u2014 a regimen of ART taken by those who are HIV-negative to prevent the acquisition of HIV - offers a promising means of prevention", " Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the safety of PrEP (Grant et al_, 2010; Grohskopf et al_, 2013; McCormack & Dunn, 2015; Molina et al_, 2015) and significant efficacy for HIV prevention", " With respect to gay men and other MSM, this includes anyone who: 1) is in an ongoing relationship with an HIV-positive partner (i_e_, HIV-discordant male couples); 2) is not in a mutually exclusive monogamous relationship with a partner who recently tested HIV-negative (i_e_, HIV negative male couples with an open relationship or perceived to be monogamous but not); 3) has had CAS or been diagnosed with a STI in the past 6 months (CDC, 2015)", "  Between one- and two-thirds of US MSM acquire HIV from their main relationship partners, driven by greater sexual frequency and higher likelihood of having CAS with the primary partner (Goodreau et al_, 2012; Sullivan, Salazar, Buchbinder, & Sanchez, 2009)", " Dynamics within couples\u2019 relationships, such as a sexual agreement (an explicit mutual understanding about which sexual and related behaviors are permitted to occur within and/or outside of the relationship (Hoff & Beougher, 2010; Mitchell, 2014)) also affect their engagement in CAS and other HIV-related risk behaviors (Darbes, Chakravarty, Neilands, Beougher, & Hoff, 2014; Mitchell, Harvey, Champeau, Moskowitz, & Seal, 2012)", " Men in relationships are also less likely to test regularly for HIV (Mitchell & Horvath, 2013; Mitchell & Petroll, 2012) and more likely to perceive themselves at less risk for HIV infection (Stephenson, White, Darbes, Hoff, & Sullivan, 2015)", " However, despite recognition of the role of primary partners and male-male relationships in shaping the risk of HIV acquisition among MSM, and CDC guidelines that highlight PrEP candidacy for some male couples, there is limited data that examines couples\u2019 attitudes towards PrEP use", " Further, Brooks and colleagues (2012) noted partnered men in same-sex relationships had high acceptability of PrEP such that being able to have anal sex without condoms, being protected from HIV infection, and perceiving to have less anxiety when having sex with an HIV-positive partner were related to their willingness to adopt PrEP", " To further expand our understanding about HIV-negative male couples\u2019 attitudes toward PrEP, additional studies are needed to help advance HIV prevention efforts with this population", " How come", " The majority of this sample thought that other male couples should be made aware of PrEP, particularly under the pretense for extra precaution and prevention from HIV_ However, while many thought PrEP was a good additional prevention option, several men stated that PrEP should not take the place of using condoms for anal sex", " If you have sex with 100 guys you\u2019ve \u2014 16 of them can give you HIV_ So I would still wear a condom", " like I\u2019m completely comfortable but I\u2019m super afraid of HIV, like, well what if I do PrEP well oh, okay, that could change it\u2019 (29, Black / Non-Hispanic, closed agreement)", " I\u2019m not gonna get HIV_ I can do and do what I want and not worry about getting my partner infected\u201d (29, White / NonHispanic, open agreement)", "  Discussion  Our findings revealed that most couples in this sample were supportive of PrEP and its purpose for helping other male couples\u2019 reduce their risk for HIV_ However, many raised important concerns that research and health programs should seek to address to help inform male couples about the effectiveness of PrEP", " For example, Young and colleagues (2014) concluded that appropriate communication methods must be implemented and operable within the context of diverse HIV literacy to better inform and help bolster the adoption of PrEP among at-risk MSM", " It is clear that the potential utility and effectiveness that PrEP can offer in HIV prevention is masked by incorrect information", " Targeted messages and access to accurate information about PrEP are critically needed to help inform male couples about PrEP, which may then help couples in deciding whether PrEP could be a strategy for managing their risk for HIV and other STIs", " Healthcare providers should also assist with this obstacle of misinformation by informing their clients (e_g_, single and partnered MSM) about PrEP and whether PrEP might be a good HIV preventive option for them to use", " This finding shows promise and implications for helping to avert new HIV infections among male couples because sexual agreements are fairly common in this population", " Previous studies have shown that establishment and adherence to a sexual agreement helps couples reduce their risk for HIV (Darbes et al_, 2014; Mitchell et al_, 2012)", "  Conclusions  Our findings highlight that HIV-negative male couples thought PrEP is an important HIV prevention option for other male couples to know, but illustrated the need to bolster education and promotion efforts about PrEP given their concerns of its effectiveness and varying opinions about condom use", " Sexual risk behaviors and acceptability of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis among HIV-negative gay and bisexual men in serodiscordant relationships: A mixed methods

privacy concerns (i_e_, Hla, H1b, H2a, and H2b), both information and social risks are shown to affect both privacy concerns", "  Of particular interest in these findings is that the length of SNS usage does not moderate the relationships between SNS risks and either of the two privacy concerns (i_e_, H3a and H3b)_ Previous research had suggested that becoming accustomed to risk over time can mitigate the effect of information risk on information concerns", "  On the other hand, a greater proportion of SNS friends with whom users also have offline relationships aggravates the effects of social risk on both kinds of users\u2019 information concerns (i_e_, H4a and H4b)_ At first glance, because SNS offline friends are people whose identities are certified and thus more trustworthy than anonymous online users, it might seem that users should feel less worried about their information being misused or misunderstood even when social risk is present", "  As for the paths between privacy concerns and personal information provision, while perceived information misunderstanding concerns affect the intention to provide both types of personal information (i_e_, H6a and H6b), information misuse concerns affect the intention to provide identity information (i_e_, H5a) but do not affect the intention to provide self-presentational information (i_e_, H5b)_ Selfpresentational information is information whose interpretation is highly associated with the context within which it is provided and that cannot be used against a user unless the user\u2019s identity is known\u2014characteristics that ironically may complicate its misuse", "  The intention to give identity and self-presentational information both affect continued intention to use SNS (i_e_, H7a and

2008_ How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice", " While much of the focus has been on the potential negative and destructive (\u2018dark\u2019) consequences of social media at work, less attention has been given to the harnessing of social media in a constructive (\u2018smart\u2019) way to enhance human resource management (HRM)_ In the context of this special issue on technology and HRM, this paper takes an exploratory approach to examine the relationships between social media use and job satisfaction using data from the Australian Electronic Workplace Survey", "  Keywords: employee voice; Generation Y; Human resource management (HRM); job satisfaction; social media; wisdom of crowds  Introduction  Considering the ubiquitous nature of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, and its potential to impact the workplace, it is surprising there is a paucity of research on its use in the workplace and as a form of communication or employee voice", " The present research adds to the emerging body of literature from a human resource management (HRM) perspective by exploring the use of social media to express concerns related to work and its relationship to job satisfaction", " Job satisfaction is an indicator of employee engagement and involvement at work and we argue the level of job satisfaction is a key factor in the desire to use social media to express concerns related to the workplace (as highlighted in the HMV case \u2014 see Jones, 2013)", " Given this and following Bryson (2004), from an HRM perspective, the literature argues that by granting employees effective voice, employers can more effectively engage employees", " Given that social media is likely to become more prevalent in the workplace, we argue it is an increasingly important area of communication for researchers in the HRM and employee relations fields to explore", "  In a strategic HRM context, Budd, Gollan and Wilkinson (2010) note that the HRM literature focuses on the importance of participation and voice to improve organisational effectiveness and these concepts are embedded in notions of organisational citizenship and organisational democracy", " This latter approach has already been adopted by major organisations such as HP, IBM, SAP Deloitte and Microsoft (Moqbel et al_, 2013)", " These countries have all experienced a decline in trade unions, the rise of HRM (emphasising direct communication) and the deregulation of the workplace that allow for potentially multiple voice channels (Holland et al_, 2011) to service an increasingly heterogeneous workforce, in an ever more competitive environment", " Within the HRM literature, researchers have advocated for employee communication or voice as a means to enhance organisational performance and competitiveness (e_g_ Boxall, Purcell, & Wright, 2007; Wood & Wall, 2007)", " However, as Marchington (2007) reflects:  Voice is probably the area in HRM where tensions between the organisation and workers\u2019 goals and between shareholders\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 views are the most apparent, because it connects with the question of managerial prerogatives and social legitimacy", " 142)  From a social media perspective, this point is reinforced by Barry and Wilkinson (2015), who argue that in the context of voice, tension between the aspirations of an independent employee voice and the desire of management to control it as part of the HRM agenda needs to be negotiated", " Otherwise, it could simply become a channel for frustrated employees to vent in response to dissatisfaction at work as was the case in the HMV scenario (Jones, 2013; Richards, 2008)", "  Measures  Use of social media to voice concerns related to work was measured using responses to the question, \u2018How often do you use social media sites (e_g_ Facebook, Twitter) to discuss work issues, incidents, or the work of your colleagues", " Research has shown that single-item measures of job satisfaction have excellent test-retest reliabilityThe International Journal of Human Resource Management 2627  and correlate strongly with multi-item measures of overall job satisfaction (Wanous, Reichers, & Hudy, 1997)", "  From an HRM perspective, this research provides an avenue of further study into an increasingly important aspect of workplace communication or potential voice", " As such, we would argue that it is an area of employee communication that HR managers should become increasingly aware of, and familiar with, to harness the potential in terms of its immediacy and impact", " Setting up a formal social media system of voice requires resource allocation to educate and manage the processes; what is clear though is that industry leaders such as HP, IBM, SAP Deloitte and Microsoft already see clear benefits in developing these strategies (Mogqbel et al_, 2013)", " E-vocie: How network and media technologies are shaping employee voice", ", & de Zuniga, H_ G_ (2010)", " Speaking up in

FB use frequency, (2) FB network size, (3) FB self-presentation, and (4) FB peer-interactions would be associated with diurnal cortisol levels in adolescents that experience critical developmental changes in brain maturation of regions sub-serving the HPA axis and emotional regulation", "  FB self-presentation behaviors were measured by indexing four questions designed to assess the extent to which participants edit, add information, and/or add photos of themselves on their FB page as respectively follows: \u2018How many times per week do you\u2019 (1) edit typed-information about yourself on FB; (2) add photos of yourself on FB; (3) add photos of yourself and others on FB; and (4) replace your FB profile picture", "  FB peer-interaction behaviors were measured by indexing three questions designed to assess the extent to which participants provided information on their friends\u2019 FB page as follows: \u2018How many times per week do you; (1) view other people\u2019s FB pages; (2) post comments on other people\u2019s FB page; and (3) add photos of other only\u2014without you depicted\u2014on other\u2019s people FB page", " Here, cortisol systemic output was positively associated with FB network size (Fig_ 1C) and negatively associated with FB peer-interactions (Fig_ 1D)", " The functional significance of our findings must be demarcated further in future studies that take into account other overlapping factors known to modulate the HPA axis", "  The relation between HPA axis profiles and depression are complex in adolescence", "  Critically for the interpretation of our findings, we found no FB associations with depressive symptoms that were in turn not correlated with HPA axis functioning", " Indeed, it is interesting to note that FB peer-interactions were negatively associated with diurnal HPA axis functioning only when other FB factors were included in the regression analysis, especially FB network size", " This is an interesting finding in line with psychoneuroendocrine studies showing that threat to the ego/self is a major determinant of HPA axis reactivity to socioevaluative threat (Dickerson and Kemeny, 2002)", " In synergy, it is thus possible that FB behaviors, personality traits, and psychosocial contexts interact ina complex fashion that the current study was underpowered to precisely link to specific HPA axis profiles", " In so doing, it will be essential to tease apart different effects observed vis-a-vis the provision versus reception of social support and HPA axis functioning (Jaeckela et al_,

Published online: 25 January 2015 \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015  Abstract A peer leader-based intervention using social media can be an effective means to encourage Peruvian gay men to test for HIV_ The objective was to explore the feasibility of recruiting and training leaders to deliver a peer intervention via Facebook to promote HIV testing", " Training consisted of three sessions focused on HIV epidemiology, consequences of stigma associated with HIV, and ways to use Facebook", " We performed pre- and posttraining evaluations to assess HIV knowledge and comfort using Facebook", " At baseline, the majority of peer leaders were already qualified and knowledgeable about HIV prevention and use of social media", " It is feasible to recruit peer leaders who are qualified to conduct a social media based HIV prevention intervention in Peru", " Menacho (><)  Epidemiology, STD and HIV Unit, School of Public Health and Administration, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru  e-mail: luis", "  Keywords Developing countries - Health intervention HIV - Men who have sex with men - Online social networking technologies - Peer leader  Introduction  Peer-leader based interventions are effective in improving health behaviors among MSM [1-5]", " For example, in a study among young MSM in the U_S_, an intervention that included a peer outreach worker, was effective in engaging and retaining participants in HIV care services (odds ratio for attending a clinic = 2_5) [6, 7]", " These interventions have been associated with increased knowledge of HIV, condom use and decreased unprotected anal  g) Springer$124  intercourse in both developing and developed countries [1-5]", "  In Peru the HIV epidemic is concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM), characterized by a HIV prevalence of 12_4 % [11] in MSM compared to 0_5 % in the general population [12]", " A cornerstone of the Peruvian National HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention strategy is the engagement of peer educators [11]", " Trained peers are sent to venues where MSM socialize (e_g_ bars, clubs, parks, saunas) to deliver condoms, encourage safer-sex behaviors and make referrals to health centers for HIV and syphilis testing", "  Delivering internet-based HIV prevention interventions to gay men seems to be feasible in Peru [13-15]", " Indeed, in a recent study that measured the preferences of MSM with regard to HIV programming delivered over the Internet, 70 % reported having had sex with an Internet partner during the previous year", " Additionally, 94, 87 and 83 % reported being interested in receiving HIV prevention messages through web pages, chat rooms and emails, respectively [14]", " For instance, the HOPE UCLA study was conducted in Los Angeles and was the first NIH-funded study to scale a community-based HIV testing intervention using an online social network [19-21]", " The HOPE study recruited and trained peer leaders to use Facebook technologies to promote HIV testing among Los Angeles-based African American and Latino MSM", " After 3 months of membership in the HIV group, participants who posted HIV prevention-related material on the wall of the secret group were significantly more likely to request an HIV testing kit (odds ratio: 11_14; p = 0_001) [21] compared to those who did not", " In addition, those in  g) Springer  AIDS Behav (2015) 19:S123-S129  the intervention condition were more likely to request an HIV test compared to those in the control group (44 vs", " The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of recruiting local peer educators who are both knowledgeable about HIV prevention and experienced using social media, to participate in a peer health intervention to promote HIV testing among MSM in Peru", "  Peer Leader Identification  We recruited participants who: (1) were male, (2) reported sex with a man in the past 12 months, (3) were 18 years of age or older, (4) lived in the Lima Metropolitan area, (5) were interested in educating others about HIV and STIs through online social networks, and (6) were experienced using Facebook", " Leaders were to promote HIV testing and safe sex behaviors by using simple and friendly language and to promote Epicentro as a place where the participants could get an HIV test without being stigmatized", " Therefore, the first training session covered essentials of HIV: the epidemiology of HIV in Peru; ways of transmission; types and importance of HIV testing; methods of prevention; and basic information about treatment (e_g_ where to access free treatment in Peru)", " The second session covered the consequences of stigma and discrimination associated with low access to HIV testing services; and methods to communicate sensitive topics using simple and non-stigmatizing language", " The third session focused on ways to use Facebook for communication, study logistics (such as HIV testing at Epicentro), and role-play exercises to integrate knowledge of HIV and the use of Facebook to make sure they were qualified to receive training", "  Pre and Post Training Evaluation  Based on the HOPE study [19], we performed a pretraining evaluation in order to assess whether leaders were  $125  qualified and ready to use Facebook to communicate HIV topics", " Similar to the HOPE study in the U_S_, the questionnaire included: general knowledge about HIV (measured with a series of 45 true/false questions; Table 1); experience using Facebook technologies (through yes/no questions on whether they had ever chatted, or sent messages or wall posts); and comfort using these technologies for health outreach and talking to another person about sexual risk behaviors", " In order to receive certification that they were qualified to conduct the intervention, leaders needed to have a passing score above 70 % on the HIV knowledge questions, report being comfortable or very comfortable using social media for health communication outreach, and receive the peer trainer\u2019s approval that they were prepared for social media health outreach", "  Data Management and Analysis  Test score means and standard deviations for HIV knowledge were calculated out of a possible 100 points for each exam (using a rule of three, those who had the 45 answers correct received 100 points)", "  g) Springer$126 AIDS Behav (2015) 19:S123-S129  Table 1 HIV knowledge scale  Statement True (1) False (0)  HIV and AIDS are the same thing  There is a cure for AIDS  A person can get

BERNHARD & MARCO DOHLE  Department of Communication and Media Studies, University of Diisseldorf, Diisseldorf, Germany  ABSTRACT How extensively local politicians use online media to communicate with others and the factors that influence their online activities have rarely been examined", " Dohle  H1) The stronger local politicians perceive the political influence of online media on the general public to be, the more extensively they use online media to spread information about their political work", " However, also journalists often use the Internet for their research and they are active social media users (e_g_, Bruns and Burgess 2012; Machill and Beiler 2009; Neuberger, vom Hofe, and Nuernbergk 2010)", "  How do local politicians perceive the political influence of the Internet in general and different online services on the public, other politicians and journalists", " Thus, hypothesis 3 can be confirmed with respect to the use of facebook and other social networks", " Here, hypothesis 3 can be accepted as well", " His current research areas include political communication, presumed media influences and _ its consequences and content analyses of radio programmes", " His

is being requested (Acquisti et al, 2012), the number of questions presented to the individual (Hui et al, 2007), individuals\u2019 perception of the level of situational risk (Poindexter et al, 2006), herding effects (Acquisti et al, 2012), a sense of control over the publication of the information (Brandimarte et al, 2013), trust in the trading partner (Chellappa and Sin, 2005; Joinson et al, 2010; Taddei and Contena, 2013), and perceived sense of anonymity (Joinson et al_ 2010)", " Adding to previous studies that described users\u2019 tendency to trade information for small monetary rewards in some online environments (Acquisti, 2004b; Beresford et al, 2011; Grossklags and Acquisti, 2007; Jentzsch et al, 2012), we would expect that the sum offered in exchange for disclosing users\u2019 offline identities will be the main factor in their decision to accept such trade offers:  H1_ The sum of money offered to virtual world users in exchange for access to their Facebook profile will predict their tendency to allow access", " Therefore, the second hypothesis is:  H2_ The level of anonymity users maintain in-world will negatively correlate with their tendency to allow access to their Facebook profile", " Therefore, the following research , question was formed:  RQ2_ How prevalent is deception as a privacy protection strategy among virtual world users, and what characterizes the deceivers", "  Facebook access in return for money (H1)  In total, 42 participants (20_7 percent), stated they have no social network account and 930 were therefore not presented with the offer to trade in access to their account", "  In-world anonymity and trading in Facebook access (H2)  Interestingly, users\u2019 willingness to grant access to Facebook shows no correlation with several variables related to users\u2019 anonymity in SL, such as whether or not the users use their real name in SL, or whether they maintain any relationships with SL residents outside SL", "  This finding partly supports H2, with one significant predictor related to sharing information with residents in SL; while the sum offered had a strong effect size on allowing access, sharing personal information with others in SL was weakly correlated with granting permission to access Facebook", " Here, too, women were less willing than men (12_7 and 288 percent, respectively) to log into their

Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychInfo, PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, and Women\u2019s Studies International_ A variety of

not use social media as a tool for collecting data about HPV vaccination", "  Studies were conducted by research teams from Canada (3) [14-16], Korea (1) [17], and United States (2) [18,19] where HPV vaccination programs had been implemented", " A fifth article [17] was a longitudinal study of public and private questions posted on a physicianresearcher created HPV information website", " A sixth

colleagues [15] as research that used \u201cthe online social media sphere\u201d to explore public discourse about HPV vaccination [19]", " How researchers define (or fail to define) this emerging research space and the virtual communities that use them may provide insight into how researchers used these platforms to collect data", "  Lee and colleagues referred to the website they created as a HPV \u201cpublic service\u201d portal for users seeking medical and health-related information of a confidential nature [17]", "  Battles [14] conducted the only study in this sample that engaged in a two-way dialogue with users over time about HPV vaccination", " Described as an exploratory virtual ethnography, the researcher performed a content analysis of discussion threads posted by female participants on an internet message board in response to the question, \u201cAre you getting the HPV vaccine", " They explained their decision to develop and use their website as a data source for exploring public knowledge about HPV transmission and infections as well as attitudes toward HPV vaccination by saying that a \u201cwell-developed information technology and internet infrastructure\u201d would enable them to engage in \u201cpublic conversation about sexual behavior [that] is traditionally considered taboo\u201d in Korea, a \u201cConfucianism-based culture\u201d [17]", " The authors drew conclusions about what type of information on HPV and HPV vaccines people sought when they consulted an internet site about HPV_ However, we cannot know if posted questions represented an unknown piece of information crucial to HPV vaccination decision-making or a simple curiosity", " It is unclear whether analyzing questions can adequately reveal a population\u2019s understanding of and beliefs about HPV infections and HPV vaccination", " negative scoring systems (sometimes including an ambivalent or neutral category) to describe HPV awareness and attitudes toward HPV vaccination", " Generally the study designs were sound and produced credible findings about attitudes toward HPV vaccination", " While the statistical surveillance used in the majority of these studies offers some sense of users\u2019 opinions, the scoring systems strip data of the context that makes these beliefs and opinions meaningful and fails to probe users\u2019 understanding of HPV vaccines that underpins the posts", " Even the relatively well-executed statistical analyses of uni-directionally mined data \u2014 as was the case in the majority of the selected studies \u2014 cannot render more visible the complexities of HPV awareness or HPV vaccination decision-making", " Therefore, research that investigates public awareness of HPV and HPV vaccination (and other health issues) must reflect this complexity in ways that go beyond a tabulation of binary responses", " Researchers who make full use of this feature might generate richer understandings of the complexities of users\u2019 knowledge of HPV infections and HPV vaccination", " When considering the specific case of HPV awareness and HPV vaccination, social networking sites attract youth and those who make decisions for youth", " If the research goal is to map public awareness and attitudes about HPV infections and HPV vaccination by collecting data from networked publics, the methodological approach must reflect the complexity of knowledge consumption and decision-making", "  Ethical issues  How do health researchers engage in ethical research in virtual communities", " Five of the six studies were based on the assumption that social media was an accessible source of unfiltered information about public attitudes toward HPV vaccination as these studies aimed to characterize public attitudes about HPV and HPV vaccinations", " This question seems especially  Page 8 of 11  salient given the sensitive (even taboo) nature of cultural attitudes toward HPV infections and vaccinations in some networked publics where data were mined", " For instance, Ache and Wallace directly quote negative and positive viewer-posted comments about HPV videos appearing on YouTube [18], making it possible to identify the accounts of those individuals whose comments were cited", " The study that paid most attention to the ethical protection of users (Battles [14]) provided little evidence on which we could evaluate the quality of design or assess the rationale behind interpretations and conclusions about users\u2019 understanding of HPV vaccination", " Youth are both eligible candidates for HPV immunization and a population that is technologically capable of using social networking sites to seek and share health information [7]", " Therefore it is reasonable to assume that youth may make up

year-olds, though it still remains among the highest in the world, with prevalence among 15-19 year-old females (5_2 %) more than four-times higher than among males of the same age (1_2 %) [2, 3]", " While South Africa has seen tremendous success in scaling up access to HIV testing and treatment, with more than 2 million South Africans now on antiretroviral treatment [4], behavior change for HIV prevention remains a critical challenge and many barriers to ART adherence exist [5], underscoring the importance of adolescents remaining HIV-negative", "  Numerous behavioral factors influence HIV risk among adolescents in South Africa", " Hazardous and harmful alcohol use, which is associated with increased HIV risk and with increased sexual risk behavior among young people, is also  g) Springer1662  very common in South Africa, with 40-50 % of adult men screening positive for risky drinking in urban settings [6, 7, 8]", " Since HIV prevalence increases with age, age-disparate sex (ADS) with older partners is an important risk factor, especially for young women [10, 11, 12, 13]", " Intimate-partner violence (IPV), which is also associated with HIV prevalence, presents another key risk factor for HIV in South Africa, with more than one in four men reporting having ever perpetrated rape and the vast majority of them starting before the age of 20 [14]", " Complex gender norms and the social constructions of manhood in post-Apartheid South Africa underlie many of these risk factors and fuel the HIV epidemic [15, 16]", " Few studies have provided estimates for the prevalence of these risk factors among youth in informal urban settlements, where HIV prevalence is highest (25_8 % among 15-49 year-olds), compared to formal urban and rural settings [17]", " Since adolescents are heavily influenced by their perceptions of peer behavior [30], we hypothesized that the aforementioned exposures in the context of online peer interactions might fuel sexual risk behavior and/or HAU among South African adolescents using social media", "  Methods Study Design  This study draws on baseline data from a 2-year clusterrandomized trial to assess the behavioral effectiveness of an

diarrhea, flu symptoms, pneumonia, spine, HIV)_ We also found that engagement measured by Likes was greater for general support and marketing/promotion than for patient support and information/awareness pages", " While 98% or more of pages listed for six conditions were relevant (flu symptoms, diabetes, breast cancer, cancer, thyroid, arthritis), less than 50% of pages were relevant for five conditions (HIV, stroke, spine, HPV, diarrhea; see Tables 4 and 5)", " For example, several health conditions were represented by few or no social support pages (HIV, AIDS, HPV, herpes, diarrhea, flu symptoms, pneumonia, anemia, blood pressure, and spine) and were largely represented by information and marketing/promotion pages", "  The relatively low percentage of social support pages for some health conditions may be due to the higher level of stigma associated with these conditions (ie, HIV, AIDS, HPV, herpes) compared to non-communicable diseases (ie, stroke, lupus, cancer, breast cancer)", "com/notes/facebook-engineering/intro-to-facebook-search [accessed 2014-05-11] [WebCite Cache ID 6PUpifjMc]  17_ Sajadi KP, Goldman HB_ Social networks lack useful

process (Powers, Advincula, Austin, Graiko, & Snyder, 2012) and is a main antecedent of patronage (Pentina, Zhang, & Basmanova, 2013; See-To & Ho, 2014)", " He found that these elements can positively influence brand loyalty, satisfaction and community identification", " Therefore based on these two mechanisms we hypothesize that:  H1_ Consumers\u2019 relationships with the: (a) brand, (b) product, (c) company, and (d) other-consumers, on social media, positively influence brand trust", " Regarding H1, it would be an oversimplification to think that whoever likes a page or becomes a member of a brand community in anyway would be heavily influenced by the brand community", " Therefore, highly engaged consumers are expected to form stronger relationships with brand elements, so we hypothesize that:  H2_ Consumers\u2019 relationships with the (a) brand, (b) product, (c) company, and (d) other consumers are stronger for customers with high engagement in the brand community compared to customers with low engagement", " Therefore we believe that brand engagement has a moderating role in translating the effect of brand community elements to brand trust  (Fig_ 1):  H3_ Brand community engagement amplifies the impacts of customers\u2019 relationships with the (a) brand, (b) product, (c) company, and (d) other consumers on brand trust", "7, which supports measures\u2019 reliability

model with four variables (i_e_ customer relationships with brand elements) directly influencing brand trust (Fig_ 1)", " Therefore, the findings support H1a, H1b, and H1c at the ", " H1d is not supported", " The result gained for H1d is counter intuitive, which we interpret in the Discussion section", "  4_5_ MANOVA analysis to test H2  In H2, we construed that the strengths of the relationship between the customer and the four elements of brand community are higher for those with higher levels of community engagement", "E) Hla: Consumer/brand = Brand trust 345 (", "037)\" H1b:

in H3_ This method is consistent with similar research (Algesheimer et al_, 2005)", "  H3 hypothesized that the effects of customer relationships with the four brand community elements on brand trust are stronger for those consumers highly engaged with the brand community", " The results support H3a and H3b and for H3d, the results are significant but in the opposite direction", " H3c is not

SNSs\u2019 communication forms suggest different audience representations based on their directedness and visibility, and, therefore, we propose that people pursue different disclosure goals in Facebook status updates, wall posts, and private messages (H1)_ We further argue that similar to findings on relational development goals for familiar versus nonfamiliar targets in Rosenfeld and Kendrick\u2019s (1984) study discussed above, disclosures directed at a familiar other, as via Facebook wall posts and private messaging, are associated with relational development goals more than disclosures directed at general others, as via Facebook status updates (H2)_ Finally, a combination of directedness and visibility should affect how people pursue social validation goals, with social validation goals expected to be most prominent in public and nondirected status updates, as most similar to the broadcasting disclosure situation described by Jourard (1971), and least salient in private and directed messages", " Therefore, we predict that people pursue greater social validation goals in nondirected status updates compared to directed wall posts and private messages (H3a), and that social validation goals are more salient in public wall posts compared to private messages (H3b) because of wall posts\u2019 visibility", " Thus, we argue that SNS users can adapt to different affordances by choosing to reveal less intimate and private information via public status updates and wall posts than via private messaging on Facebook (H4)_ Moreover, in accordance with the functional approach to disclosure, disclosure goals are expected to affect disclosure intimacy (H5), with less intimate disclosures associated with social validation goals compared to other self-disclosure goals, especially the more personally involving relational development goals (H6)_ Finally, closing the loop, disclosure goals are predicted to mediate between Facebook communication forms and disclosure intimacy (H7)_  Method  Participants and procedure Eighty-one undergraduate students (72_7% female) from a university in the northeastern United States who had a Facebook profile were recruited to participate in this study, in exchange for extra credit in communication and psychology courses", " H1 predicted differences in disclosure goal pursuit between Facebook status updates, wall posts, and private messages", " As gender had a significant relationship with goals in the multinomial model above, the binomial models included the effect of gender and the random effect attributable to individuals to control for multiple messages sampled from each individual_ The results, including model statistics, LS-means, and odds ratio, are summarized in Table 2_  As predicted by H2, relational development goal was found to be more prominent in directed wall posts and private messages than in status updates, with odds of a relational goal about 11 times higher in wall posts than in status updates, p <", "  Consistent with H3a predicting that social validation goals are more prominent in status updates than wall posts and private messages, the effect of

messages, p < _001_ Consistent with H3b, the difference between wall posts and private messages was also significant, p=", "  Disclosure intimacy  Next, we tested predictions about how Facebook conditions (H4) and disclosure goals (H5) affect disclosure intimacy", "05_ Consistent with H4 and H5, the effects of condition and goal were significant: For condition, F(2, 644) = 8_45, p <", "76_ As can be seen from the patterns of LS-means after the Bonferroni adjustment in Table 3, disclosures via private messages were more intimate than disclosures either via status updates, p < _001, or via wall posts, p < _001_ Consistent with H6, disclosures prompted by relational goals were more intimate than disclosures prompted by social validation goal, p < _001, or social control goal, p <", "

for example: Dyson, 1998; Horn, 1998; Kollock & Smith, 1999; Markham, 1998; Rheingold, 2000), the main reasons for the prevalence of self-disclosure on the internet are the lack of oral and non-verbal

We report on a female patient with genetically proven HD who suffered an acute, severe psychosis without motor or cognitive impairment", "  Psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in HD patients than in the general population: 3-11% for psychosis, 10-52% for obsessive compulsive symptoms and 33-69% for affective symptoms [19-28]", " The earliest of the cognitive symptoms in presymptomatic HD patients is decreased emotional recognition which can be detected up to 15 years prior to predicted motor diagnosis [31]", " Psychosis in HD patients is usually associated with cognitive impairment and occurs mainly after the start of motor symptoms [20,23,24]", "  In the literature, psychotic symptoms predating motor manifestation of HD are rare", " However, this case reminded us that neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, cognitive impairment and even severe psychosis are associated with neurodegenerative disorders like HD and often predate motor symptoms", " We suggest to include psychiatric criteria for the clinical diagnosis of HD [2]", " This would increase awareness for psychiatric symptoms early in the clinical course and help future HD trials to be started early after clinical manifestation, offering chances for neuroprotective approaches", " f4c66bd51e8db1 1f55e1701af937a419_  [3] Biglan KM, Zhang Y, Long JD, Geschwind M, Kang GA, Killoran A, et al_

occupier\u2019s knowledge, the occupier is not treated as a publisher of that statement prior to his becoming aware of it;  (ii) Once the occupier discovers its existence, he may be treated as a

consented to or ratified its continued publication;  (iii) Where the occupier becomes aware of the libel but the circumstances show that removal or obliteration is very difficult or very expensive,

learning (Hew & Brush, 2007)", " Hew, W", " Blogs typically share the following features: individual ownership, hyperlinked post structure, post updates displayed in reverse chronological order, and archival of posts (Sim & Hew, 2010)", " Individuals typically use Facebook to maintain existing relationships usually involving people with whom they have already formed an offline connection such as an existing friend, or a current or former classmate (Hew, 2011)", " Objects have properties that allow them to be taken, dropped and so on, which make it possible for students to learn by doing rather than merely learning by listening to the instructor or reading text (Hew & Cheung, 2010)", " Hew, W", " These databases are frequently used by other researchers in their search for empirical articles (e_g_, Luppicini, 2007; Rinke, 2008; Sim & Hew, 2010; Wang, Odell, & Schwille, 2008)", " Hew, W", " Hew, W", " Hew, W", " Hence, additional research is needed to determine whether the involvement of students in designing and producing their own podcasts may influence their learning performance (Hew, 2009)", " One study reported no difference (Neumann & Hood, 2009)", " Hew, W", " Three failed to conduct pre-test to determine whether the two groups were equivalent to start off with regard to their prior knowledge or ability of a certain subject or skills (e_g_, Heafner & Friedman, 2008; Neumann & Hood, 2009; Rick et al_, 2002)", " One study employed three different tutors to conduct the course (Neumann & Hood, 2009)", " More specifically, three studies investigated the use of blogs in English language learning (Arslan & Sahin-Kizil, 2010; Hsu & Wang, 2011; Wong & Hew, 2010), one examined the impact of blog on student critical thinking in social studies (Salam & Hew, 2010), while the other two studied the use of blogs in dental science and physical education, respectively (El Tantawi, 2008; Papastergiou et al_, 2011)", "  Of the three studies that examined blog use in language learning, two reported positive gains (Arslan & Sahin-Kizil, 2010; Wong & Hew, 2010)", " Positive gain was also reported in the use of blog in social studies (Salam & Hew, 2010), and dental science learning (El Tantawi, 2008)", " Hew, W", "  On the other hand, Hsu and Wang (2011) reported no significance difference", " Unlike the other studies on blog use in writing, Hsu and Wang (2011) examined the impact of blog on reading", " Using a pre-posttest two group non-randomization design Hsu and Wang (2011) studied the effect of blogging on students\u2019 reading performance", " However, the use of two different instructors in Hsu and Wang\u2019s (2011) study might have introduced a confounding tutor variable although the same course material was used", "  Based on previous research findings, a very tentative conclusion may be made - the use of blog appears to have a positive impact on student writing and critical thinking ability (e_g_, Arslan & Sahin-Kizil, 2010; Salam & Hew, 2010; Wong & Hew, 2010) rather than reading, or learning a physical skill such as the techniques of shooting a basketball", "  Second, two studies utilized a weak-experiment design that employed a one-group pre-posttest design, with no comparison or treatment group (Salam & Hew, 2010; Wong & Hew, 2010)", " In the Wong and Hew (2010) study, a writing model guide was used, along with blog, as an outline or mind-mapping guide to help primary school students during the planning process of the writing", " In the Salam and Hew (2010) study, a set of Socratic questions was used (e_g_, questions of clarification, questions that probe assumptions, questions about viewpoints, questions that probe reason and evidence), along with blog and podcast to help secondary school students improve their critical thinking", " Hew, W", " Hew, W", " Essentially, the notion of using a software agent as a learning advisor to students could be implemented using other applications such as Microsoft Agent characters (Baylor & Ryu, 2003), instead of virtual worlds (Hew & Cheung, 2010)", " Hew, W", " So far, the use of social media (e_g_, Facebook and Twitter) is mainly for social networking (Hew, 2011)", " Hew, W", "  Hsu and Wang Language (2011) Two (undergrad", "  Wong and Language Hew (2010) (5th grade) One-group (Singapore) preposttest design; sig", " =

hotel blog the empirical evidence verified all the causal relationships described in hypotheses H1, H2, H4, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10_  Specifically we found that the intention to use blogs is influenced not only by the attitude (H7) and usefulness (72) relationships of the TAM model, but also by ease of use (H5)_ Regarding the new relationships included in the TAM model, we find that users will trust or rely more on hotel blogs that they perceive to be easy to use (H6) and that ease of use has a positive influence on the attitude of tourists (H9) and intention to use (10)", "  The hypothesis that trust influences the perceived usefulness of these sites (H8) was not verified and therefore rejected (for non-standardised beta and other results see Table AII in Appendix 3)", "  The Facebook behavioural model rejected hypotheses H2, H5 and H10_ No empirical evidence was found to reject the remaining hypotheses", " Specifically, the relationship between trust and usefulness proves to be very significant for tourists who use Hotel Botanico\u2019s Facebook profile (HS)_ Furthermore the relationship between perceived ease of use and trust (H6) is also fulfilled; trust has a positive influence on attitude (H9); and this construct has a positive influence on intention to use (H/7)_ The same relationships are found with regard to Tripadvisor", "  As with the Facebook model, the Tripadvisor behavioural model rejected the hypotheses that usefulness and ease of use have a positive influence on intention to use (H2 and H5)_ The model also rejected the hypothesis on the relationship between trust and attitude (H9)_ However the rest of the hypotheses were not rejected", " For example the positive relationship between trust and intention to use (H70) was fulfilled for

Since giant and supergiant oil fields dominate current production, they are good indicators for the point of peak production (Robelius, 2007; H6d6k et al_, 2009)", " There is now broad agreement among analysts that the decline in the existing production is between 4\u20148% annually (H66kK et al_, 2009)", "  b) In mature regions, an increased drilling effort usually results in  little increase in oil production because the largest fields were  found and produced first (H66k and Aleklett, 2008; H66k et al_,  2009)", " (Murphy and Hall, 2010)  A further challenge is that, strictly speaking, for

significantly predicted intention to engage in frequent Facebook partner-monitoring", " In partial support of Hypothesis 2, intentions significantly predicted frequent Facebook partner-monitoring

engage in frequent Facebook partner-monitoring", "'\u00b0  For Hypothesis 4, age, gender, and time spent per login were not significant predictors; however, daily Facebook logins predicted both

established adolescent smokers who have more entrenched smoking behavior", " How nicotine dependence unfolds among adolescents has received considerable focus in recent years, particularly given findings that younger smoking onset is one of the strongest predictors of persistent use (Patton et al_, 1998)", "2010_06_013  argued that initial symptoms of dependence, for some adolescents, can appear soon after smoking initiation (Difranza, 2008; DiFranza & Wellman, 2005; Kandel, Hu, Griesler, & Schaffran, 2007; O'Loughlin et al_, 2003; Savageau, Mowery, & DiFranza, 2009)", " More recently,

McDonald, 2000; Grych, Harold, & Miles, 2003), the emotional security hypothesis (Davies & Cummings, 1994, 1998; Davies, Harold, Goeke-Morey, & Cummings, 2002) and the specific emotions model (Crockenberg & Forgays, 1994, 1996; Crockenberg & Langrock, 2001a, 2001b) suggest that poor marital functioning constitutes a stressor leading to children\u2019s emotional arousal_  Although there has been considerable interest of late in integrating physiological measures into studies examining associations between parent\u2019s marital functioning and _ child outcomes (Ballard, Cummings, & Larkin, 1993; El-Sheikh, 1994; El-Sheikh, Ballard & Cummings, 1994; El-Sheikh, Cummings, & Goetsch, 1989; Gottman & Katz, 1989; Gottman & Levinson, 1992; Katz & Gottman, 1995, 1995b; Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002), surprisingly, there are no published studies with children examining how parent marital quality is related to the activity of one of the body\u2019s main physiological systems for responding to stressors, the hypothal amic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis), and its major endproduct, cortisol", " HPA axis activity, as measured by levels of salivary cortisol, is of interest in relation to marital functioning for several reasons", " They proposed that the effects of these variables on children\u2019s HPA axis activity may be an important pathway by which the effects of these family factors influence children\u2019s outcomes", " Elevated cortisol near what should be the lowest point of the diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis (in the evening) is thought to be of particular importance to dysregulation of the HPA axis (Gunnar & Vasquez, 2001 for a review), the early onset of depression (Dahl et al_, 1991), the occurrence of sleep disturbances (Gillan, Jacobs, Fram, & Snyder, 1972) and impaired memory consolidation (Plihal & Born, 1999)", " It is therefore of interest to examine whether family functioning variables are more salient for younger children\u2019s HPA axis functioning, or whether they are equally important for HPA axis functioning in both age groups", " \u2018To understand whether slope effects are driven by wakeup values, bedtime values, or

both, we conducted identical sets of hierarchical regression analyses for children\u2019s wakeup and bedtime levels of cortisol, the final models of which are presented in Table 5_ Prior research has suggested that bedtime cortisol levels are thought to be more subject to immediate environmental influences, whereas wakeup levels may reflect more long term influences on the HPA axis (Gunnar & Vasquez, 2001)", " Our results may imply that mother\u2019s emotional functioning is less likely to be detected by the child (other than through parent-child interactions or its effects on marital interactions), whereas low maternal parenting quality and poor marital functioning are more likely to pose more immediate and salient threats to the child\u2019s well-being or goals, resulting in the activation of the HPA axis", " These caveats aside, the current study suggests that a detailed examination of family functioning may help us understand individual differences in children\u2019s HPA axis functioning, not only at the extremes of parental functioning such as domestic violence, abuse or neglect, and parent psychopathology, but also for more common variations in marital, parenting and emotional functioning in the normal range", ", Stam, H_J_, et al_ (1988)", " After disaggregating the avoidance cluster into its constituent elements of effort ful avoidance and emotional numbing,
