Keywords LEMAS, Quantitative methods, Organization-level precursors, Police use of social media Paper type Research paper  Introduction Police agencies in the USA use social media as a tool for public safety promotion on a wide basis (Hu et al, 2018a)", " The contemporary studies on police use of social media in the main explore what the police tend to do on social media (Crump, 2011; Dai et al, 2017; Heverin and Zach, 2010; Hu et al, 2018a; Kelly, 2014; Lieberman et al, 2013; O\u2019Connor, 2017; Procter et al_, 2013; Schneider, 2016)", " Much of the contemporary research being done on police use of social media focuses primarily on the documentation of what the police tend to do on social media (Crump, 2011; Dai et al, 2017; Heverin and Zach, 2010; Hu et al, 2018a; Kelly, 2014; Lieberman et al, 2013; O\u2019Connor, 2017; Procter et al_, 2013; Schneider, 2016)", "  Hu et al_ (2018a) advanced our understanding of what the police do on Facebook in their systematic investigation of more than 7,000 police Facebook posts", " Hu et al_ (2018a) were able to identify the crime fighter, the traditional cop, the public-relations facilitator and the mixer types of agencies, agency types which could be classified as such from their pattern of postings made on Facebook (see Hu et al, 2018a)", " Later, Hu et al_ (2018b) used the same data set to explore public reaction to police Facebook posts", " They found that people were more likely to like and make comments on the content of police personnel and police\u2014public relations (Hu et al, 2018b)", " And people were more prone to like police Facebook posts with pictures and narratives (Hu et al, 2018b)", " An argument made by Hu et al_ (2018a) suggests that although over 96 percent of police agencies in the USA claim that they have used social media, many of them are not very active with social media assets and demonstrate little ability to make productive use of it; it is reported that this is the case even among many large police agencies (Lieberman et al, 2013)", " Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that in the area of social media use, it is likely that police agencies which emphasize community-oriented policing as a major part of their philosophy of law enforcement are more likely than non-COP agencies to use social media as a tool of community engagement as a reflection of politically potent community pressures to do so (Hu, 2016)", " Based on the contingency theory (Walker and Katz, 2018) and Maguire\u2019s (2003) theory on organizational complexity (also see Damanpour, 1991; Nowacki and Willits, 2018; Roberts et al, 2012), the following hypothesis tested here is as follows:  H1_ Police agencies with greater organizational complexity (e_g_ vertical differentiation and functional differentiation) are more likely to use social media than their less complex counterparts", " Since many studies investigating organizational correlates to innovation find that larger police agencies are more likely to innovate (Carter et al, 2014; Morabito, 2010; Nowacki and Willits, 2018; Roberts et al_, 2012), the following hypothesis tested is as follows:  H2_ Police agencies with larger workforces are more likely to use social media than police agencies with fewer personnel", " Accordingly, the following hypothesis tested here is as follows:  H3_ Police agencies which are using information-based and internet-based technologies are more likely to make use of social media", " Previous studies have found that many police agencies use Facebook as a tool for engaging the public online, and many Facebook posts are community policing-related in content (e_g_ Hu ef al, 2018a,b; Lieberman et al, 2013;  Social media and the police  659PIJPSM 49_4  660     Procter et al, 2013)", " Accordingly, we treat police use of social media here as \u201can online community-oriented policing effort\u201d as suggested by Hu (2016)", " Therefore, the following hypothesis tested here reads as follows:  H4_ Police agencies, which emphasize community-oriented policing, are more likely to use social media than those which do not do so", " Previous studies (e_g_ Hu et al, 2018a,b; Hu, 2016; Katz, 2001; Nowacki and Willits, 2018; Walker and Katz, 2018) suggest that police agencies post many types of community-related information on their Facebook pages", " We assume that if a police agency has a clear statement on community-oriented policing and provides community-oriented policing training to its police officers, it may be more likely to use social media since social media clearly is a useful tool for public engagement (e_g_ Hu ef al_, 2018a)", " Over the period 2010-2018 studies have explored police use of social media with content analysis, case study approaches and quantitative analyses of various kinds (e_g_ Beshears, 2017; Crump, 2011; Dai et al, 2017; Grimmelikhuyjsen and Meyer, 2015; Harms and Wade, 2016; Heverin and Zach, 2010; Hu et al, 2018a, b; Kelly, 2014; Lieberman et al, 2013; O\u2019Connor, 2017; Procter et al, 2013; Schneider, 2016)", " It is, of course, efficient to broadcast this type of legitimacy- enhancing information through social media to promote a favorable social image (also see Hu et al_, 2018a)", " Once a police agency comes to understand that the majority of people it serves are making progressively more use of social media, and come to appreciate the potential benefits of using social media to reach difficult to engage populations such as the youth (see Beshears, 2017; Harms and Wade, 2016; Hu, 2016; Hu et al, 2018a), police agencies will likely to be pressured by citizens and elected officials to use social media to communicate more effectively with community members", " Given these considerations, whether police agencies make use of social media as tools for promoting community-oriented policing (see Hu, 2016) cannot be fully determined by the data used in the current study", " Using existing tools developed by social media companies, the police can do many things to build effective communication bridges to the communities and stakeholders they serve (see Dai et al, 2017; Hu et al, 2018a)", " Relatively small police agencies can also be very successful on social media (Hu et al, 2018a)", " Since any social media pages usedby the police can be viewed from almost everywhere in the world (see Hu, 2016; Hu et al, 2018a), a global comparative study should be conducted in the future to explore other factors such as economic status, internet availability, cultural values and mores or other contextual factors have an impact upon police use of social media", ", He, W", " 54-66_  Hu, X", "  Hu, X", " 544-572_  Hu, X", ", Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ", " 74-92_

the following:  H3_ The tone of scientists\u2019 tweets directed at journalists expresses more negative emotions compared with tweets directed at scientists", " Hence, we expect that  H4_ Scientists

line with H3_ The same pattern can be observed when scientists address civil society actors and politicians", "  We assumed that the extent to which scientists use words related to certainty in their

Hypothesis 1b_ Spectators will express negative emotions on social media in accordance with the scoring success of the opposite team", " Based on the satiation principle included in the opponent-process theory (e_g_, Aragon, 2017; Larsen & Stastny, 2011; Solomon, 1980), I developed the following two hypotheses:  Hypothesis 2a_ Spectators are unlikely to express positive emotions on social media in accordance with the continued scoring success of their preferred team", "  Hypothesis 2b_ Spectators are unlikely to express negative emotions on social media in accordance with the continued scoring success of their opposite team", " Accordingly, by applying the emotional ambivalence principle included in the opponent-process theory (Aragon, 2017; Larsen & Stastny, 2011; Solomon, 1980), I developed the final two hypotheses:  Hypothesis 3a_ Spectators will express a surge of positive emotions on social media in accordance with the scoring success of their preferred team soon after the scoring success of the opposite team", "  Hypothesis 3b_ Spectators will express a surge of negative emotions on social media in accordance with the scoring success of the opposite team soon after the scoring success of their preferred team", " 1 and 2_  4_1_ Accountability of the affective disposition theory  First, I assumed that spectators are more likely to express positive emotions corresponding to the scoring success of their preferred team, as hypothesized in Hypothesis 1a_ As plotted in Figs", "  Conversely, fans expressed negative emotions on social media when the opposite team scored, consistent with Hypothesis 1b_ For example, when the Denver Broncos made the first field goal at 18:45, the frequency of tweets marked with a Charlotte location stamp that expressed anger, fear, and sadness reached their second peak near the time of the score", " Accordingly, the frequency of the tweets marked with the two location stamps expressing emotional words showed a consistent pattern of fluctuation corresponding to the scoring success of the fans\u2019 preferred team (Hypothesis 1a) and the opposite team (Hypothesis 1b), although the depths and lengths of the emotional fluctuations varied", " These results supported the hypothesis that spectators were less likely to express positive emotions on social media in accordance with the scoring success of their preferred team as their preferred team continued to successfully score (Hypothesis 2a)", " These results supported Hypothesis 2b, as fans were less likely to express negative emotions on social media in accordance with the scoring success of the opposite team following the opposite team\u2019s continued scoring successes", "  Lastly, according to the opponent-process theory and as hypothesized in Hypothesis 3, a surge of positive emotions was expected when the fans\u2019 preferred team scored a point after the opposite team scored; conversely, a surge of negative emotions was expected when the fans\u2019 opposite team scored a point after their preferred team scored", " In the following sections, I discusses detailed theoretical implications corresponding to the findings of: affective disposition (Hypothesis 1), emotional satiation (Hypothesis 2), and emotional ambivalence (Hypothesis 3)", "  First, the patterns of emotional fluctuations displayed in tweets were generally congruent with the predictions of the affective disposition theory (Hypothesis 1)", "  Second, the results reflected the habituation of emotional experiences characterized in the satiation

in intensity of news engagement (H2a)_ While Australian-Korean differences in power distance were not evident in political news retweeting behaviour, they may be manifest in the following of politicians on Twitter - we found that Australian political retweeters follow, on average, nearly twice as many politicians as do their Korean counterparts", " With regard to diversity of news engagement our hypothesis regarding the impact of political affiliation (H1b) was not supported, but we found support for our hypothesis relating to diversity of news engagement and culture (H2b)_

log data as results of the user-computer interaction", " Moreover, considering the problem of information overload, which is important in HCI (Kwon, Kim, Duket, Catalan, & Yi, 2015; Sasaki, Kawai, & Kitamura, 2015, 2016), it is valid to question the assumption\u2019s validity", " In this study, using a quantile regression approach, which can provide more details on the distribution of dependent variables (Hao & Naiman, 2007; Ishiguro, 2016), our results suggest the importance of cognitive constraints on online socializing in a webbased service", " Using panel survey data, Burke, Kraut, and Marlow (2011) indicated that receiving messages from friends in Facebook is associated with increases in perceived bridging social capital_  Research on the relationships between microblogs, including Twitter, and social capital may be placed in the trends of research on SNSs according to social capital theory (Chan, Wu, Hao, Xi, & Jin, 2012; Ye, Fang, He, & Hsieh, 2012; Zhang, 2012)", " He has explained that people have two main motives related to their investment in social capital: maintaining existing resources and gaining additional resources (Lin, 2001)", " As these previous studies thus show, users should refrain from investing in too large an SNS network to gain social capital_  Too large an online network is also a problem with regard to capacity for information processing, which is important in HCI (Kwon et al_, 2015)", " Therefore, we offer the following hypotheses:  H1: There will be a positive association between a socializing motive and the number of mutual follows in the lower tails of the distribution of size", "  H2: There will be a positive association between an informationseeking motive and the number of one-sided follows in the lower tails of the distribution of the size", "  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION 551  In addition, the theory underpinning H1 and H2 also predicts that Twitter users who have a higher information-seeking motive are likely to have fewer mutual follows, while users with higher socializing motives tend to have fewer one-sided follows", " Therefore, we pose two hypotheses:  H3: There will be a negative association between an informationseeking motive and the number of mutual follows", "  H4: There will be a negative association between a socializing motive and the number of one-sided follows", "  To test these four hypotheses, we use quantile regression, in which models specify the changes in the conditional quantile of the dependent variable associated with a change in the covariates (Hao & Naiman, 2007)", "  3_ Analysis and results  The research hypotheses (H1-H4) and research questions (RQ1-RQ2) were examined using quantile regression analyses", " Based on Hao and Naiman (2007), we analyzed the following five quantiles: the lowest 10th percentile (q10), the lower quartile (q25), the median (q50), the upper quartile (q75), and the top 90th percentile (q90) of the distributions of the Twitter network sizes", " These results support H1_ For the information-seeking motive, the coefficients were negatively significant at the 25th and 50th percentiles (q25: b = -2_71, p < _01; q50: b = -5_32, p < _01)", " Therefore, these results partly support H3_  The results for one-sided follows are depicted in Table 4_ For the information-seeking motive, the coefficients were positively significant, except the 90th percentile (q10: b = 3_01, p < _001; q25: b = 4_65, p < _001; g50: b = 8_72, p < _001; q75: b = 14_01, p < _001)", "  Thus, these results cannot be said to support H2_ However, for the socializing motive, the coefficients were negatively significant at all five percentiles (q10: b = \u20143_44, p < _001; q25: b = -5_80, p < _001; q50: b = -11_37, p < _001; q75: b = -21_65, p < _001; q90: b = -41_65, p < _001)", " Thus, these results support H4_  To address RQ1 and RQ2, the results for one-sided followers are depicted in Table 5_ For the socializing motive, the coefficients were not significant at the 10th, 25th, or 50th percentiles, but negatively significant at 75th and 90th percentiles (q75: b = \u20148_23, p < _001; q90: b = \u201427_45, p < _001)", "  The results of the analyses support hypotheses H1 and H4 for socializing motives", " As H1 predicted, the socializing motive was positively associated with the size of mutual follows only in the lower tails of the size distribution", " In addition, as H4 predicts, users with a higher socializing motive have a smaller number of one-sided follows", "  Though H2, regarding an information-seeking motive, was not supported, H3 was partly supported", " Contrary to the prediction of H2, an information-seeking motive had a significantly positive relationship with one-sided follows, except for the 90th percentile", " Although H3 predicted significantly negative relationships between an information-seeking motive and the number of mutual follows at all percentiles, the results show that only the coefficients at the 25th and 50th percentiles were significantly negative", " Although the relationships represented by mutual follows, in studies on HCI, are interpreted as \u201cstrong ties\u201d (Kivran-Swaine, Govindan, & Naaman, 2011; Kwak et al_, 2011), reciprocal relationships on Twitter are not significantly related to the socializing motive but to the virtual popularity motive in the upper side of the distribution of mutual follows (Table 3)", " This indicates that, in the field of HCI, it is important to investigate what specific

Chintagunta, Gopinath, & Venkataraman, 2010; Dellarocas, Zhang, & Awad, 2007; Duan, Gu, & Whinston, 2008; Forman, Ghose, & Wiesenfeld, 2008; Goes, Lin, & Yeung, 2014; Goh et al_, 2013; Li & Hitt,

comment in real time about TV shows and advertisements, thus offering marketers the opportunity to exploit multiple types of media channels jointly (Business Insider, 2013; Dumenco, 2012; Hill, Nalavade, & Benton, 2012)", " Therefore, we formulate our first novel hypothesis as follows:  H7_ Brand-related UGC is less likely to respond to (offline and/or online) brand advertising campaigns on YouTube than on Facebook or Twitter", " Accordingly, we formulate:  H8_ In their brand-related UGC, users are less likely to share their location on YouTube than on Facebook or Twitter", " Hence, we formulate:  H9_ Brand-related UGC is less likely to associate the brand with a user personal experience on YouTube than on Facebook or Twitter", " Hence, we formulate:  H10_ Brand-related UGC created and shared in the context of brand purchase is less likely to be observed on YouTube than on Facebook or Twitter", "\u00b0 Therefore, we formulate:  H11_ Brand-related UGC created and shared in the context of brand consumption is less likely to be observed on YouTube than on Facebook or Twitter", " Accordingly, we hypothesize that:  H12_ Brand-related UGC is more likely to feature explicit brand recommendation on YouTube than on Facebook or Twitter", " For instance, it has been regularly used by researchers interested in analyzing content related to advertisements, media stories, websites,

less likely observed on YouTube (23, 36) than on Facebook (74, 68) or Twitter (60, 61)", "  5_2_6_ Brand recommendation  Finally, we do not find confirmation for our hypothesis H12 on whether users

positive attitudes toward the microblog, resulting in strong community commitment:  H2_ Perceived similarity is positively associated with community commitment", "  H3_ Source credibility is positively associated with community commitment", "  On the basis of the bias effect of HSM, this study further proposes that the two source characteristics, namely perceived similarity and source credibility, may influence information quality in brand microblogs", " We therefore propose the following two hypotheses:  H4_ Perceived similarity is positively associated with information quality", "  H5_ Source credibility is positively associated with information quality", " We thus propose that if followers have formed a strong community commitment to the brand microblog, then they will increase their participation level to maintain their relationship with it:  H6_ Community commitment is positively associated with participation", " Following these perspectives, we hypothesize that followers\u2019 community commitment to a brand microblog will influence their brand loyalty, showing a high tendency for product purchase and recommendation behavior:  H7_ Community commitment is positively associated with brand loyalty", " We propose the following hypothesis:  H8_ Participation is positively associated with brand loyalty", " This finding confirms the bias effect within the

watching television news will have a positive effect on participation in climate discourse online through interpersonal conversation (H4, full mediation), while reading print media will positively affect participation directly (H5a) and indirectly (H5b, partial mediation)", " Accordingly, we expect that interpersonal conversations about climate change will motivate participation in climate

ISSN 0021-9916  ORIGINAL ARTICLE  Behavioral Effects of Framing on Social Media Users: How Conflict, Economic, Human Interest, and Morality Frames Drive News Sharing  Sebastian Valenzuela\u00ae, Martina Pifia, & Josefina Ramirez  School of Communications, Pontificia Universidad Catdlica de Chile, Santiago 8331150, Chile  We hypothesize that generic frames influence what news people share on Facebook and Twitter through three different routes: emotions, motivations, and psychological engagement", " Here, instead, we study the number of times users have actually shared news with their online networks", " Applied to news content, this approach combines popularity with \u201ccontagious behavior\u201d (Heimbach, Schiller, Strufe, & Hinz, 2015)", "  The literature on digital sharing also highlights the role played by emotions and emotional regulation (Heimbach & Hinz, 2016)", " To the degree that entertaining content is a positive predictor of sharing, as suggested by research on the uses and gratifications of news sharing (Lee et al_, 2011), it could be expected that statistical information and technical language that tends to accompany an economic frame is less entertaining and, thus, less viral_ Because economic frames trigger less recall, are less arousing, and are less compatible with typical motivations for news sharing, we expect that:  H1: The use of an economic consequences frame decreases the number of shares an article receives on social media", " Valenzuela et al_ Framing Effects on News Sharing  H2: The use of a human interest frame increases the number of shares an article receives on social media", "  H3: The use of a morality frame increases the number of shares an article receives on social media", " Valenzuela et al_ Framing Effects on News Sharing  measured content complexity (Heimbach & Hinz, 2016; Kim, 2015) with the proportion of words identified by LIWC that fall into the cognitive mechanisms category (e_g_, cause, know, ought)", " Her assessment is supported by the content analysis data, which show that 69% of political news employ a conflict frame, compared to 29% in news about other issues", " Put another way, holding all else constant, stories with an economic angle have on average 53 less Facebook shares than stories without this angle, which is in line with H1_ Thus, using the same comparison as before, the mere presence of an economic consequences frame could put an otherwise average story from the top 20% to the bottom 80% of the distribution of Facebook shares", " Thus, although this study did not support H2, there is still a possibility that a human interest angle impacts news sharing when it triggers emotional arousal_  Morality  In stark contrast to the human interest frame, adopting a morality frame increases the likelihood of sharing the article on both Facebook and Twitter quite substantially", " Thus, H3 received strong support", " Recent work on which emotional dimension (i_e_, arousal or valence) or specific feelings (e_g_, hope, anger) drive news virality could be integrated with framing effects to have a more complete understanding of the affective mechanism (e_g_, Heimbach & Hinz, 2016)", " How journalists intervene in the conflict frame building process", " The social news gap: How news reading and news sharing diverge", ", Kim, H_ S_, & Albarracin, D", ", & Hinz, O", ",

messages is similar to the concept to Stuart Hall's negotiated reading, which indicates acceptance by the viewer of the preferred meaning that is portrayed in the media content, but simultaneously resists and modifies the media's meaning in ways that reflect the individual's own experiences and interests (Hall, 1980)", " His study focused on a UK-based entertainment program called Wife Swap, in which two families with different social and economic status swap wives", " Therefore, it can be assumed that social viewing contributes to cognitive elaboration about programs, and consequently, opens gateways to the mediated public sphere (H1)_  H1_ Social viewing will have a positive relationship with cognitive elaboration", "  H2-1_ Social viewing will have a positive influence on bridging

results of the SEM are presented in Fig_ 2 and Table 4_ H1 postulated that social viewing would lead to cognitive elaboration of television program content", " Social viewing positively affected bridging social capital at a significant level (6 = 0_338, p < 0_001), supporting H2-1; but did not influence bonding social capital (6 = 0_086, p = ns)", " Therefore, H2-2, which predicted that bridging social capital will mediate the relationship between social viewing and cognitive elaboration was supported", "  In regard to cross-cutting talk, the results of H3-1, which postulated social viewing will have a positive influence on crosscutting talk was supported (6 = 0_322, p < 0_001), meaning that heavy social viewers tend to have talks with diverse people, including those who have different views from their own (see Fig_ 2)", " Additionally, H3-2, predicting that cross-cutting talk will mediate the relationship between social viewing and cognitive elaboration, was supported", "

rules of the game (see also Shaw & Hill, 2014)", " This aspect of online recruitment implies that, from an organizational point of view, along with retaining its institutional seat in quadrant HI, #tutorpool also occupied a place within the two entrepreneurial quadrants (I and I)", " From an empirical point of view this should be reflected in the communication around #tutorpool: (H1) #tutorpool\u2019s communication network will, across time, display higher levels of bridging structures, pointing towards an attitude of reaching outside the more closed core group, and establishing bridging ties", " We hypothesize that (H2) a core group of core user-organizers played a pivotal role in producing, receiving and brokering information across time", " In hypothesis form, (H3) offline-only tutors should display significantly lower levels of community attachment to #tutorpool when compared to the rest of the initiative\u2019s participants", "  To answer the hypotheses focused on the network level (H1- H2) we need different types of information", "  To understand the formation of structural signatures such as bridging (H1) and bonding ties (P1), we follow Burt\u2019s (2005) approach, and use his main metric for brokerage or the presence of bridging ties: network constraint index", " For H1 we calculate the average constraint and modularity coefficients across each group of 1,000 simulations, and compare them to our observed networks", "  Results  Organizational Logic and Brokerage in the #tutorpool Network  H1 predicted that the communication structure of the #tutorpool network had initially a highly dense structure, pointing towards the development of strong communicative ties between core members", " Computing the value for the edges

result confirms H3, namely that a minority of highly committed users (in this case a team composed of User1l, User2, User3, User4 and @tutorpool), played a significant role in generating and brokering information to the network\u2019", "  In order to test H1, namely that #tutorpool\u2019s communication network will, across time, display higher levels of bridging structures, we further disentangle the network's diffusion practices", " We interpret this as evidence that the network also put effort in reaching outside the closed group establishing bridging ties, and that it succeeded at a certain point in time - supporting H1_ Also when the network becomes much smaller (i_e_ last month), and only due to the size, we could expect that the levels of brokerage get smaller", "  Journal of

author:  Hai Liang, Journalism and Media Studies Centre, The University of Hong Kong, Room | 14, Eliot Hall,  Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong", " In this sense, we expect that users with public accounts are less likely to add geo-tags to their tweets, because people are reluctant to disclose location-based activities to unfamiliar users:  H1_ Users who have protected their accounts are more likely to add geolocation information in tweets than those who have public accounts", " Therefore, we hypothesize the following:  H2_ The positive relationship between network size and self-disclosure is stronger for public Twitter users than for protected users", " Therefore, we hypothesize the following:  H3a_ Active users are more likely to protect their profiles than inactive users", "  H3b_ Active users are more likely to disclose their geolocation in tweets than inactive users", " Increased social media experience could also lead to heightened privacy concerns, because experienced users are more aware of how their data could be collected and used without permission (Singh and Hill, 2003)", " Therefore, we hypothesize the following:  H4a_ Users registered earlier are more likely to protect their accounts", "  H4b_ Users registered earlier are more likely to disclose geolocation in tweets", " Given the mixed results, this study uses a global random sample of Twitter users to test the following hypotheses anew:  H5a_ Users from highly individualistic societies are more likely to protect their Twitter accounts than those from the societies with low individualism", "  H5b_ Users from societies with high uncertainty avoidance are more likely to protect their Twitter accounts than those from societies with low uncertainty avoidance", " According to H/, users who protect their accounts from public access are more likely to disclose their geolocation information, because they might infer audience representations from the boundary defined by the privacy setting on Twitter", " Following this rationale, users in collectivistic societies are more inclined to disclose personal information when their accounts are protected:  HO_ The difference in self-disclosure between protected and public accounts is smaller in individualistic societies than in collectivistic societies", "  Concerning H/7/, the correlation at the society level is significant yet weak (Spearman ss

of all earnings-related tweets, we further distinguished them from other earnings-related tweets to determine whether H/b can still be supported after we exclude these reminder tweets", " Therefore, based on the results, H/b is supported", "  4_2 Assertive IM strategy  Our second set of hypotheses \u2014 H2a and H2b \u2014 concentrates on the use of self-presentational patterns in earnings-related tweets as means of assertive emphasis", " H2a predicts that firms tend to employ self-presentational patterns, including textual narrative and quantitative and visual formats, to emphasise positive information over other types of information (i_e_ negative and neutral) on Twitter", " The results for H2a are summarised in Table 8_ Notably, the mean number of positive earnings-related tweets that contain narrative information is 5_09, while the mean number of other types of narrative earnings-related tweets is 1_65_ This difference in means is significant at the 0_01 level", " H2a is thus supported", "  H2b predicts that firms with improving performance are more likely to adopt multiple selfpresentational patterns than their counterparts on Twitter", " The results thus support the prediction of H2b_ Therefore, multiple self-presentational patterns are not only used to emphasise positive earnings-related information but are also more likely to be employed by improving performers to enhance their favourable position", "  Hypotheses H3a and H3b address dissemination manipulation for the purpose of assertive emphasis", " H3a focuses on the dissemination of different types of earnings information, while H3b compares the proportion of adopters of dissemination tools considering improving and declining performers", " In H3a, we anticipate that firms are more likely to disseminate positive earnings-related tweets than negative and neutral earnings-related tweets on Twitter", " H3a is thus supported", "  H3b predicts that firms with improving performance are more likely to disseminate their earnings news than their declining counterparts on Twitter", " The results for H3b are presented in Table 9_ The mean proportion of improving firms adopting dissemination tools (74_2%) is significantly higher than that of declining performers (42_3%) at the 0_05 level", " The results thus also support H3b_ Therefore, the results for H3a and H3b suggest that dissemination tools are more likely to be inserted into positive information than into other types of information and that improving performers are more likely to exploit

immigrant society, HK has witnessed much immigration and emigration in recent centuries", " Especially since the handover of HK to China, a growing number of mainland Chinese have flooded into HK_ Both Hongkongese and mainland Chinese in HK are experiencing an identity transition and negotiation (Li, 2015)", " Previous studies have suggested that a social identity classification based ona Mainland-Hong Kong dichotomy does not fully reflect the dynamics of social identity with HK (Brewer, 1999; Ma & Fung, 2007)", "  Treating the concept as a continuum rather than as a dichotomy, this study conceptualizes social identity with HK as the degree to which people feel strong ties with HK society regardless of their region of origin (mainland China or HK)_ Previous research based on

identity with HK and political participation present highly politicized attributes given the frequent conflicts between the Mainland and Hong Kong and the various protests against the Chinese central government", " In light of the current situation, it seems very likely that the geographical origin of individuals strongly affects the formation of their social identity toward HK_ Still, social identity with HK has been found to show some fluid, contingent, and negotiating attributes", " Ma and Fung (2007) proposed four main social identities in HK \u2014 Hongkongese, Hongkongese but also Chinese, Chinese but also Hongkongese, and Chinese", " This categorization is thus still somewhat limited in its capacity to fully capture the dynamics of social identity with HK_  Holding a more fluid view of social identity, this study considers HK social identity as lying somewhere along a single continuum and to not be based simply on geographical origin", " Indeed, an increasing number of the mainland Chinese, especially college students, have flooded into HK as long-term stayers intending to obtain permanent residence after graduation (Li, 2015)", " Their perception of social identity toward HK is also influenced by their efforts to be integrated into HK society, interactions with its local communities, and individual values (Li, 2015)", " Hong Kong residents from mainland China could thus possess relatively high social identity toward HK and be motivated to participate in collective political action by their intention to integrate into the city with which they identify502 @)

nonetheless, impactful on the formation of HK social identity", " That is, HK students with HK region of origin will reveal a higher HK identity than their mainland China counterparts", " Based on the

Murphy, and Simonds 2007, 2009) because social media use is expected to increase the (perceived) teacher\u2019s immediacy (O\u2019Sullivan, Hunt, and Lippert 2004)", " That is, use of social media in the class reduces the psychological distance between pupils and teacher (O\u2019Sullivan, Hunt, and Lippert 2004)", " We test this reasoning with the following second hypothesis:  Hypothesis 2: The more SRL opportunities a teacher provides via social media a) the more the teacher appears as helpful, and b) the more the teacher appears as understanding", "Learning, Media and Technology 83  3_1_

teachers who know of more colleagues who have used social media are more likely to use them in the class", "  Next, we test hypothesis 2 claiming that teachers who more intensively use social media in

information capital, partially supporting H2_ Among the social media capabilities, rehearsability (/=0_313, pb <0_001) has the most significant influence on information capital_ Possible explanation might be that rehearsability enables message senders on an SMN platform such as Facebook to acknowledge, save, edit, and review messages any time before sending them out to the other users; thus, making it easier for the receivers to cognitively understand the messages (Cornelius and Boos, 2003; Dennis et al, 2008; Kock, 1998)", "  The results further reveal that social capital (f=0_129, p<

comment sections to contain two communitarian indicators, ingroup acknowledgments (22_33 times as likely) and calls to action (3_91 times as likely)", "  H2 predicted that liberal individualist

progressives are more deliberative than conservatives on two of three metrics\u2014cross-cutting justifications and cross-cutting questions\u2014lending some support to H3b_ The extremely low

advent of social media has added a confounding layer to the consumer decision process", " Therefore, as depicted in Hla, H1b, and Hlc, a positive wine blog credibility assessment provides the reason to trust the wine blog as an information source", "  H1a, b, c: Credibility perceptions (source, site, and message) positively predict trust in the wine blog", "  Blog source credibility (H1a)  Perceived source credibility becomes increasingly important as gatekeeping of credibility of information shifts to the recipient of the information (Haas and Wearden, 2003)", "  Hla: Wine blog readers who perceive the author of the wine blog to be more credible (source credibility) will form a more positive attitude of trust toward the wine blog", "  Blog site credibility (H1b)  The definition of site credibility is generally accepted as the perceived believability of information by the receiver based on the characteristics of the channel through which the source sends the message (Newhagen, 1997)", " Thus, we anticipate an impact in the model based upon site evaluation as follows:  H1b: Wine blog readers who perceive a wine blog site to be more credible will form a more positive attitude of trust toward the wine blog", "  Blog message credibility (H1c)  Message credibility refers to an evaluation of information characteristics that produce believability (Slater and Rouner, 1996)", "

individual\u2019s positive WOM behavior about it", "  H2b: Positive wine blog trust predicts a behavioral intention of recommending the accessed wine blog to others", "  Continuing participation with the accessed wine blog (H2c)  The value consideration in the calculative component of continuing participation with the same wine blog is based on the perceived benefits of using the wine blog and the cost of leaving to find another information source", " A blog\u2019s success, and thus its influence, is dependent upon the continued development of participation with the wine blog (Hsu and Lin,

Netherlands is a worldwide frontrunner in terms of adoption of Twitter adoption (Comscore, 2011) with an adoption rate of 16% in 2010 and 27% in 2011_ Already many studies have focused on Twitter in the broader political context from distinct angles, for instance from a content analysis perspective (Zappavigna, 2011), a network perspective (Hsu & Park, 2011) or a political collective action perspective (Segerberg & Bennett, 2011)", " Here, we distinguish between the simple adoption of Twitter and the activities candidates conduct on Twitter, as well as their Twitter popularity as indicated by their number of followers", " Thus, the following hypothesis was formulated:  Hypothesis 1) Candidates from parties that do not belong to the establishment have adopted Twitter more frequently and microblog more frequently than candidates from parties that belong to the establishment", " The question whether lower prioritized candidates indeed use Twitter more than higher prioritized candidates leads us to formulate the following hypothesis:  Hypothesis 2) The less priority the party has given a candidate, the more likely this candidate adopts and uses Twitter more actively", " The hypotheses therefore are:  Hypothesis 3) The more seats a party has lost in the last general elections (external shock), the more likely it is that its candidates use Twitter;  Hypothesis 4) Candidates from political parties with uncertain leadership (internal shock) will use microblogging more extensively", "  Hypothesis 5) The older a candidate is, the less likely he or

platform's interactive opportunities and their persistence on using the platform in a broadcasting style (Graham, Broersma, Hazelhoff, & van\u2019t Haar, 2013; Grant et al_, 2010), fewer explanations have taken into consideration the interaction between the supply and demand side, as well as the platform's own limitations and \u201cdark sides", " Specifically, taking into consideration that information and communication technologies have built-in features and affordances that can both enable and constrain social relationships (Latour, 2005), we investigate the possibility that the demand side, that is, the users, bolstered by Twitter\u2019s wall of anonymity and the platform's weak capacity to deal with harassment and trolling (Hern, 2015), may also be falling short of their responsibilities as counterparts in political discourse", " A baseline hypothesis thus is:  H1: Politicians make broadcasting rather than engaging use of Twitter", " Perhaps the most well-documented cause for citizens\u2019 disconnection from politics is that they feel that they have no say in what government does and no influence in political affairs, primarily because there is little public dialogue and discussion with politicians, and because politicians do not listen to them (Coleman & Blumler, 2009; Hay, 2007; Henn, Weinstein, & Wring, 2002; Stoker, 2006)", " Following this rationale,
